"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it || [removed] || Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost || I have to agree with this. I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier. 

I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that. 

Sorry for my rambling. That’s my two cents on the topic. || Great rule! I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.   
  
And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  
  
It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  
  
It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  
  
Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems. || Thank you for posting this.... as much as I want to have a more personal connection with people here, I realize how that pre-disposes OP's to VERY bad advice and people who are suffering are often in an altered state that DOES NOT benefit others.

That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).

Love you guys so much, I wish everyone as much happiness as possible, especially coming up on the holidays. || I really appreciate this post! 

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha || I’m guilty of doing this and, as others have pointed out, it has always been out of goodwill but it is too unpredictable and therefore dangerous. Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; 
I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.

I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. 

After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.

Thank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out. || Thank you for this ! Offers like this intend to help but no.. Just no lol || Thank you so much for this. || I think I broke this rule more than once in the past..I'm sorry guys I will think more before leaving a comment. || I agree ""pm me anytime"" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a ""I'm here to help message me anytime"" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it || Wow. I understand that the rules are the rules, but you just painted *everyone* who offers that as either a psycho or a predator. I must say I am feeling like one now because of all the stuff you have said about a simple act of kindness, which is the only reason I ever offered to do so. Sad really. But, the rules are the rules. Now I have some hard thinking to do. Again, just wow... || Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. 

He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. 

A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. 

But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk. || I personally don't come here looking for helpers or to become a helper for other people. I'm mostly looking for people I can feel more connected to, for whom I can feel true empathy. And if I could make friends that would be very nice but I know that's not easy.

I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.

Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me (which is also why I'm thankful to this community, I can relate to people, they can relate to me). || I wish I would've seen this sooner. I apologize for all the infractions. || I think this is a good rule, thanks. Someone's who's depressed doesn't need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it, then maybe feeling even more like no one cares. Besides, perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM's. || Good shout. I would never presume to offer that kind of one-on-one interaction mainly because *I do not want that myself*, and I am pretty sure most of us are in the same boat. || I apologize for breaking this rule. I never had the intention to put anyone at risk by doing so. I do hope I'm not going to break this again. || I really agree. People start talking to me and then just stop. In that moment of depression I feel like we're friends, but I guess not.",1572360722.0,2359,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,depression
"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.","Its getting harder to pretend that everything is ok || I am emotionally detached from everyone around me. Just numb to everything, all the time. Disassociation is a persistent, natural state for me. I miss having friends to talk to, but I fear being open about my feelings and don't want to burden others with how bad my mental state is. I don't want to be hurt again. I just feel sorry for myself and haven't been able to stop feeling this way for a very long time now. I'm my own worst enemy. I know it's my responsibility to improve my situation and no one else's, but it's so hard to do without help. || constantly on the verge of crying, feel so alone, can’t find a job/don’t even know what i want to do for a job, have a bunch of health issues going on, and have to find a new place to live on top of that || I have nobody to talk to. I moved out of state to follow my daughter and son in law when they had a baby so I could be a close grandma. My daughter doesn't talk to me any more than she has to to make arrangements and communication regarding my time with my grandson. My husband doesn't talk to me anymore other than to talk about his job. I have no friends. Nobody to talk with daily. I do check in with my mom every day, but she has dementia. I am alone. I go to work, come home, have a glass of wine, do whatever housework needs done and go to bed and do it all over again. The loneliness has made my depression and anxiety worse and I am concerned that my lack of mental stimulation is going to start to effect my brain health. I see no way out though. I had a large circle of friends and colleagues before we moved away. But politics and distance has ended that. I live only in my mind. Disassociation has become my new permanent state when I'm not at work. || Things have been really hard recently. I just want to be reassured and comforted more than anything else in the world right now. || I’m working 6-7 days a week to support my family.  Wife has been out of work since February.  I have no friends.  I have no life other than work.  Anxiety and depression are creeping back into my existence again after years of meds and therapy.  I’m burnt out.  I’m exhausted mentally and physically.  I have no family out here to help me cope. || Why whenever I speak someone will always talk over me. I always thought it was a coincidence and it's just me ignore all the time that no one talk over. So I count in this month how often people talk over me the result is ""everytime when soneone ask widely"" like ""does anyone want this"" if I don't reply NO ONE will say a thing, but if I speak up the other will talk over sometime change subject and I will fade in a background. Like is it a curse or something?

If it was a normal conversation it happen not too often but not to frequency just 50/50.

So I now learned that I should have never speak up. I should just stay quiet as I was. No one care. Nobody || 8 billion people on this earth. Yet, here i am all alone. || I find myself just constantly having the negative thoughts in my head. I’ve tried countering them but they are true so how do you counter that? They say I’m fat and ugly and a useless blob and darn I am. Idk how to counter a true negative thought. Especially when they bulldoze through my mind. I just keep sobbing randomly now. I’ll just suddenly remember how awful the world is and how much I hate it here. And then I sob about it. This is me medicated. Unmedicated I am suicidal so I know it’s an improvement but I don’t think I’ll ever get to normal. || I don’t have the energy for anything anymore, it’s exhausting to speak, to eat, to brush my teeth, to bathe, to clean my room, to feel. I just want to sleep, I can’t man. || Every time someone starts to get close to me, they eventually stonewall and are gone. I'm gonna be alone forever dealing with emptiness and pain. I feel like I'm screaming and everyone is ignoring me. || How do I always manage to fuck everything up. || Annoyed at how i feel bad pretty much all day and yet 2 hours ish before i take my meds i feel better. 

And like i wish these meds started working for once || I feel like anything bad that happens in the people’s lives closest to me is always my fault even if I have nothing to do with it. I feel so guilty all the time. I used to take meds but I hate the idea of having to rely on something everyday just to feel “normal.” They quieted my bad thoughts for sure, but idk I feel like I also know my thoughts aren’t real and I should try harder to ignore them. All I do is cry over anything and everything and it’s so annoying and I’m an anxious wreck no matter what. I don’t want to have to rely on meds to get through the day. But I also always have the thought that if I didn’t have family that cared about me I would be long gone. Guilt keeps me here || On antidepressants now, so the mental ""dips"" are far less severe, but still feel stuck in life. It's getting irritating because most of the time I can't focus even without external things (people calling etc), but other times there's this nagging feeling that some external force put me in this metaphorical box and wants me to stay here, angry and depressed, not achieving anything. || I feel like my depression has come back lately, if it ever left. Sleeping in and napping again. Kind of giving up on job searching for now to have a mental break and just let myself grieve and rest. Mental fog. Physically tired. Usually lift weights but that’s been hard this past week. I’m going good about eating healthy and taking care of myself and mostly not putting on a show for anyone. I feel angry, frustrated, lost, alone, drained, down. || i refuse to dissociate from the reality of the world around me, no matter how much i should do it to protect “my peace”, because this peace comes at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. and that is making me very depressed. i am seeing children burned alive. bombs made out of my country’s taxpayer money dropping on families. paramedics shot and buried. i am moved by the atrocities and grieving the collective pain felt by all of the people. i am no longer the same || I wish I  hadn't taken time with my partner for granted and asked for more. I wish I could have been the person they needed and not make them feel like they are the problem || I’m at the point where I’ve come close to accepting that I’ll be alone for life. I’ve already come to terms with being single for life. But it’s hard to go through life without friends. Especially when someone claims they care about me but I are the very last thing on their mind. Sometimes I wish I could just die. Nobody notices I’m alive, and nobody would notice I’m dead either. || I swear theres people that don't understand depression, but then it's also is if there's a subset of people that don't understand ""burnout"" or feeling numb or feeling stuck or like life and everything is pointless. Some people just default to generic advice. What's that phrase? ""People hear but they don't listen"". A big issue of mine is the constant sense of disconnect from other people, like I don't belong and people won't ever accept me as me.

I swear sometimes it's like I'm speaking in a different language, or the response is akin to those routine ""reading off a flow chart"" type situations where you call for service / help and its like someone is reading off a page instead of responding.

I am stuck in what is by far the worst depression I've ever experienced in my entire life,This is beyond anything I was prepared to handle. I'm already on two antidepressants and they are not helping at all. I'm slowly but surely losing everybody and everything. I have suicidal thoughts nearly all day everyday. All I have to look forward to is opioids tomorrow then it's back to hell. My soul cannot take this any longer. I can't get any help because I don't have any money or insurance. I don't have a working car anymore. I've lost everything because I can't function. I haven't showered or washed my clothes in weeks. I'm only eating once every day or two. My own mother is hardly even speaking to me anymore as well as all my friends except my ride or die and even she's having a hard time handling it which I understand. I can barely put into words how absolutely God awful this is. I just want it to stop. I am in so much pain. Please tell me I'm not alone.,"Not alone not at all || Hey, just wanna say that you're not alone! It's encouraging seeing others like myself as well so thank you for this post. || I’m reading your post in a better place than I was just a few weeks ago when I thought of suicide many times a day. That should show you that even in the worst depressive episode you have ever had, you can just get through it. Idk how it happens, but it can change. So keep that hope that there is an end to this episode and feeling better, because it’s possible even though you can’t see it at the moment. 

You are never alone in these thoughts and feelings. So many of us understand you completely! Please go to the ER if you want to truly harm yourself. If you can, ask if you can stay with a family member and truly ask for help. So many of us who live with life-long depression have a hard time asking for help. Just ask, you might be surprised. 

Also, I want you to make me a promise that you will get up and shower. Do that and brush your teeth. I know it feels so hard to do right now, but it will feel so good to get that done. Then tomorrow, promise me you will go sit outside for a little while. Just get some air and let the sun touch your skin. It will help, I promise. Everyday have one thing like that. Just plan one little thing that you can do. It will suck, it will feel so hard to get up and do it, but you will not regret it. 

We are here for you my friend. You haven’t lost everything, because you still have us. ❤️ || Not alone, friend 🩷 || You’re not stuck, I feel like that every single day especially after losing my mother who was my everything. 
The only peace I get is sleeping, then waking up and dreading the day. Tried all medications to no avail. 
Best of luck to u and anyone else suffering. 🙏🏽💜 || Hey you are not alone.
Do you wanna talk? || So sorry to hear that you are having such a rough time. I hope it doesn't come to this point, but if you ever get to the point of harming yourself, go to the ER. They can't refuse you treatment, and maybe going there will give you a break to help you plan a treatment. Is there a mental health facility near you?  Can you ask any other family to help you? Maybe you could go live with them. Please don't give up on yourself. A mental health problem is the hardest thing to go through. I have been treated for depression for over 40 years, and somehow find the strength to go on, but I sometimes don't know how. So my thoughts and prayers are with you. Please seek any help you can. Post a update to let us know. || You are not alone, I'm going through another cycle of this, losing my house, lost my dream job.  Doing drugs just to feel something. Trying my hardest and slipping further and further towards the early end.  That really sucks you're going through it too.  Just keep fighting and try to ride it out and take any help and small wins you can get. || You are not alone. Life is hell. || You’re not alone! Also you haven’t really lost anyone, they probably just don’t know what to do and feel overwhelmed as well. Compassion fatigue is real. But please know people care and you are not alone at all. The world is so cruel and scary at the moment. But have hope.

Life is a scam. I’m done,"Why can’t I die bro why? Let me die already

After 18 years old life sucks more than it already does

Let me die. I am so guilty for everything and I do not deserve to live

","being an adult is a scam most definitely || Why is it okay to put someone to death, but it’s not okay for people to do it themselves? || A lot of life is just luck. Whoever says you are in control and to take control of your life to change it are only correct to some extent.

It’s luck which part of the world you are born into, the social and financial status of your family, how your parents treat you, what school you go to, what genes you have, what health issues you will develop, if you randomly suffer some random accident like a car crash, so many things in life are just luck and they determine 99% of how your life will go yet people are all like “take the reigns of your life” as if they know wtf it’s like to be in your shoes. Some people just have a shitty life and no matter wtf they do , it keeps being unlucky. Sometimes there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes it does feel like a scam. || eighteen years is so young. i wonder what i would be like if could start again at 18.

  
im sorry for your pain. || It may sound bitchy but people don't live because they deserve to.  People live because someone nut in someone, and all the weird biological shit that happened over millions of years all the way back to the primordial soup from which our single-celled ancestors emerged because the air and water got good and they learned to reproduce, eat, shit, and eventually swim and walk and change. 

Your guilt doesn't have an impact on your capacity to live.  If it did, people would just be smote by some divine intervention every time we act out. There are times I wish it was like that.  There are lots of times (mostly when I see the news) where I wish existence was a thing we ""deserve"" through meritocracy and goodness. 

It's one of the reasons I feel depression, because it's inherently unfair.  Because it feels like goodness doesn't get enforced or maintained, and the concept of being deserving is just a thing our parents taught us to keep us from being feral. There's no cosmic scales that balance themselves on the weight of human action, behavior, or intention.  

We are, unfortunately, the masters of ourselves and unfortunately, with free will.  And with those things, we just have the capacity to do good and bad in equal measure to whatever definition good and bad have to the perspective of the person viewing/doing/experiencing the good or the bad.

If you really are so bad that you ""deserve"" to die, that deserving part is a construct you invented based on your morality or someone else's.  It's got nothing to do with surviving, objectively. 

One day you'll die.  We all will.  But no one deserves it and no one asks to be born or live.  So we got nothing better to do than just keep on keepin on and trying to make things better for ourselves til then.  

Anyway, sorry I went on so long.  Please consider /r/SuicideWatch. || Would you like to talk? || Becoz you got no choice || I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY || Die also good, you'll experience life in a different dimension || Because dead people can't be exploited || > We are, unfortunately, the masters of ourselves and unfortunately, with free will.

A dubious statement.

good morning, that is nice of you to say about us. you should know of course that this applies to you as well. You are loved. You also have so much going for you it is just you cannot see that right now.

I can assure you that whatever wall you perceive as blocking you or in your way, is an illusion. my advice to you is to analyze that wall and start to pick at it. you will see that it is merely full of holes and is not there. once you break out of that prison you will of course be in a much larger one... but still another walled in area to explore. find that wall and then see through it too.... this goes on and on and on for eternity. 

you are only stuck when you imagine yourself as stuck. your mind is so powerful that it will ensure that you are stuck until your mind lets you out. || Bro try anime, there are so many good titles to watch!

My life was over before it ever even began. (rant),"I'm a 33 year old man. I wasted my entire young life wallowing in self-loathing, and indulging in destructive habits, mental, emotional, and physical. I've never been athletic and I was never taught anything about nutrition. I was smart when I was young, but lazy, and a chronic procrastinator. Needless to say my mind and my body have just about wasted away.

About a year ago I made the decision to join the Army. I had nothing going for me anyways. I hated the menial, servile jobs I was working. The military was a huge opportunity for somebody like me. Not only would I be getting payed to be trained in a field that is actually my dream job, I would have a chance to change my mind, and my body around.

I've been putting in a ton of effort. I gave up drinking alcohol, I gave up caffeine to help fix my sleep, I completely overhauled my diet to the point of being obsessive, and I've been exercising harder than I've ever exercised in my life... or so I thought. For all my effort, I haven't seen any much improvement if at all. I don't feel stronger at the gym, running never gets any easier, and I don't look any better. But I acknowledge that it's my fault. I guess I'm actually not trying as hard as it feels like. I'm weak as hell, and although I sweat a lot and strain my muscles, I always leave the gym feeling like I could have and should have done more. People say that exercise is great for depression, but I often leave feeling down, and angry at myself for being so inferior. I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been in my life and it's so pathetic to say that my best is still worse than the base line.

I feel like I only just started truly trying, and yet it feels like it's already too late. I feel old. My body hurts. I have knee and lower back pain. I'm ugly, I hate my body, I have no confidence. I'm surrounded by young, athletic guys in their prime. They're smarter that me, have more going for them than me. I don't fit in with anybody. I feel like I don't get other people and other people don't get me. I don't have any friends here or back at home. I feel lonely, sad and angry all the time, and I don't have anybody to talk to. I feel like a rat trapped in a cage and I don't see anything ever improving.","Solidarity, brother. I’m a 30y/o woman and I could have written this. I’m married, but no matter what my spouse tells me, this is exactly how I feel. I’m starting meds tomorrow. Do you have the ability to go on depression medication to get you out of the hole your mind is trapped in? That might help you take some more steps. The road to getting healthy is a marathon, and it feels like 10 marathons with depression. || If youre in a calorie deficit to lose weight its hard to get stronger that doesnt mean youre inferior its just the way it is || If op is depressed then definitely think about seeing your gp regarding medication, but know that your chances of getting into any of the service branches will definitely be negatively impacted. || I was about to say this.

Contemplating about Suicide that I was very sure to commit,"For the past two months, I’ve been thinking about ending my life more than ever before. I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, and although I’ve had a few serious attempts in the past, this time feels different.

This time, I’m not acting impulsively. I’ve made a plan. I’ve picked a date. And with each passing day, it feels more like something I’m meant to do. I’ve even researched famous suicides looking for inspiration, trying to make sure nothing can go wrong.

I’m currently in therapy and on antidepressants, even on the maximum dose, but nothing seems to change. Today I told my therapist everything: the method, the plan, and why I feel so certain this time. He asked how he could help, and I told him nothing could this is a final decision, and nothing in this world could change it. I was completely sure until I got home.

Now, I’m torn again. Part of me still believes that my problems are too deep and permanent to ever be solved at least not within my lifetime. I don’t just hate myself. I feel like I was never meant to exist among other people. Like I’m something else entirely. That I don’t belong here, that I never will.

Even if I kept going, nothing would really change. I’ll always feel this way. Suicide doesn’t feel like a choice it feels like my destiny. But then something my therapist said made me pause. It made me feel guilty. I don’t know how to go from here. What would you do?

I don’t know. I can’t elaborate better than this I would like to do but I’m just tired.
Thanks for reading <3","I'm in somewhat of a similar boat. No date picked yet but a definite plan. I keep telling myself, one more day. Just one more. I keep going through with it, every day. It hurts a lot and I don't know if the agony will ever go away but I just keep telling myself one more day. 

I recite this to myself in my mind often.

""A man builds a dam to hold back the ocean as it terrifies him,

He builds and builds and builds, high into the sky a dam so magnificent and strong. 

When all is finished he finally feels safe, he checks his work every day looking at every nook and cranny, anxious that nothing will change.

One day the man stands in front of his dam and sees something, a crack and he panics as it all will come crumbling down. 

The man thinks to himself,What happens to me when this dam breaks?"" 

I'll leave you with this. Good luck to you.",1753787920.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc8pg5/contemplating_about_suicide_that_i_was_very_sure/,depression

Immediately depressed about being single after talking to co-workers who are in stable relationships.,"I had about a whole hour of neutral stable emotions this morning..maybe even could say I was happy. And then I showed up to work, bumped into a friend and he starts talking about his relationship and trying to get married. And that was fine for about a whole minute, then when another co-worker comes by they both start talking about their relationships and im just standing there like an idiot with nothing to say because im single, with no dates, no recent relationships, and no self esteem to pursue dating. I had one failed 5.5 year relationship that ended 3 years ago and almost nothing since then. I've had a couple short lived relationships that I got dumped by each time. And it just hit me this morning about the likelihood my 5 year relationship was the best chance of having a life long partner and it wasn't even the best relationship. Im over 30, I have no ""game"", I have no money, no friends, no quality job outlook.

I just want someone to listen but I can't speak.,"In real life, I can't talk to anyone, I don't put any effort into maintaining or creating any sort of relationship / friendship because I just don't want to talk. But I am so desperate to be heard by someone.

Diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression and recently borderline personality disorder.

I have a three year old child, full time single parent. Currently studying online. Live alone in a rented property with my child. They are the only reason I don't end it all right now.

I have no family. Well I have parents and a brother but they are unwell and it is hard to see them as we live far apart. 

Child's father is not involved in her life. DV.

I thought I would have been so much more by now.

If I didn't have my child I promise I would end it all, but I can't leave her, she would end up in someone elses care and no one would love her like I do or give her everything as I so desperately try to.

I am so alone. I have been single for three years. When I was young I always had boyfriends etc. Which when digging deeper, was probably due to childhood trauma.

Ruined my life.,"Ive only been truly in love with one person since I was 15, I’m 25 now. The only meaning and purpose ive made in life was to love this girl. She was the only person I would’ve married and had a family with.

It’s been over three months since we broke up and I know deeply that I will never love someone again because I’ve never been able to. I try but no one is ever her. 

Prior to this year I had to end a six year relationship because all I ever did was dream about this girl even after not talking to her for six years. 

My life now is dreaming about what could’ve been, her having children with the new guy etc. it’s very rare I don’t wake up from dreaming about her. No matter what I accomplish or do I think about her every morning and night. Nothing matters anymore I just do good things hoping one day something will work out but I know deep down there is no plan B and I’ll be haunted by this relationship for the rest of my life. 

Ultimately she probably did love me and I ruined the best thing that will ever happen to me. I won the lottery and blew it. I’d trade all the money in the world to just to live in a tent with her. 

I have nothing meaningful and never will. ","Give it time. I am just getting over a relationship that I had 3 years ago. You're so young. Try to embrace and find some new worlds within this world. <3 Big hugs to you. || I separated with a girl that i thought was truly perfect and the only one for me. I was tired of people saying ""you'll find another"" or ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"" because deep down i seriously knew 100% that i would find nobody else as good as her for me. It's now been a year since ive felt that way. It honestly just comes with time, but it might be a bitter while.

I do believe that you will find someone else for you. They may never be the SAME as her. They'll be DIFFERENT, yet just as good. The face that you will only ever find someone different probably makes you think that there is no way theyll be just as good.

I don't feel human anymore.,"I want to be completely honest with my emotions here because after reading other people's posts, I feel like this is the only place where I can talk my emotions without being judged and told what's wrong with me. I'm not sure what depression anxiety is and whether I have it or not, but I had a really traumatic background in which I was bullied by the majority of the people in my life. I'm now a 26-year-old boy who recently graduated and works a 9-to-5 job. I don't have any friends so far, and I've never really engaged in a meaningful conversation with a girl. It's not that new people, like those in college or my colleagues, are unwilling to talk to me,  rather, I tend to keep my distance from everyone because Whenever I try to converse with others, my heart races rapidly, my face flushes, and my mind goes completely blank even to the childrens except of my mom. I’m not sure why this happens every time. Last year, there was a moment when I finally resolved to put an end to my suffering; I bought a rat poison, locked myself in my room, and wrote a few words to my mom. However, once again, I found myself too cowardly to go through with it. I feel so ashamed of myself, my existence, and how much of a coward I am. This shame keeps me awake at night, and I constantly regret allowing others to bully me, thinking I should have chosen to stand up for myself . It's an awful feeling when your soul does'nt respect you . Honeslty  living like that is incredibly difficult. I'm unsure if I'll ever come to respect myself or feel proud of who I am. However, I deeply desire to experience that feeling someday, even though I have no idea what steps I need to take to attain it.

"What's the point of trying anything, if nothing ever works out, no matter how much effort it took?","M, 24. I got rejected by another woman just yesterday. I don't know how many times I was rejected up until now, but there were lots of them. I never had a girlfriend. I've never been told by anyone that I'm loved and wanted(my family doesn't count, because the relationship between me and my family was never exactly perfect). Just like I was never able to find a well-paid job. I started investing several months ago, but I only lost money so far. I can't even learn stuff because I get easily overwhelmed. I'm forced to eat several different kinds of pills every day, because I was born with several incurable illnesses. I always start spiraling so hard when I fuck something up that I want to kill everyone in sight and then off myself as well. Nothing ever goes according to my plan and I'm sick of it. I just want to go home, lie down, stare at the ceiling and never leave my room again. Why the hell should I bother about anything in this world, when I still end up on the shorter end of the stick despite how much work I always put in? ","Look- you are basing your main problems on love. That’s a slippery slope. I had SEVERAL suicide attempts by 22- I have a dotted line with a date tattoo’d around my neck; “3/23/22” which was my expiration date. Set that my senior year in hs on 3/23/17 that in 5 years if I didn’t have a girlfriend, my own place, and a nice car that I’d kill myself. In that 5 years I had an apartment but had to move back in with mom & dad within 9 months, had a nice car but it got totaled, and I was currently with my now wife (we were just dating then). So, I had accomplished all my goals but I didn’t have them all at once. And you know what? I didn’t kill myself- not because I was happy but because I was determined to become that way. I still am in some regards. My relationship has fixed none of my issues. My nice car I have now has fixed none of my issues. And I still live in a house my parents own and pay the rent on, just thankfully they don’t live here with me anymore- and that hasn’t fixed my problems either. Love from others solves nothing, neither does material possessions. What solves things is loving YOURSELF! Wake up tomorrow, look in the mirror and tell yourself this: “I’m tired of being a self-centered bum, I’m tired of being reliant on other people; and I’m no longer going to accept a life that I do not deserve”!

Hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either. And honestly, I don’t think anyone can help me, other than ending it all.

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half, but it only seems to help for a few hours at a time. 

au revoir  ","Man, I’ve been there. I feel ya. My one thought when I was deep in the trenches was saying ‘hey I guess I’ll just stick around to see what happens next.’ Humor got me through the rough patches lol continues to do so!

Have you ever heard of the Pareto Principle? I’m not the best at explaining it so I encourage you to look it up in relation to mental health but in essence it says that 20% of the crap we do can impact 80% of our mood. I would ‘gamble’ to say (sorry, had to) that your gambling is part of that 20% that’s negatively impacting your mood, aka that 80%. If you’re able, try taking a break from it. See how your outlook changes. 

And stick with your therapy. You are worthy of love and belonging and happiness, just as you are right now. You’re enough. The world needs you here, even if you haven’t figured out why yet. I’m still working on that part myself, but life has gotten a hell of a lot better since I decided to ‘stick around and find out what happens next.’

Then I was also abused by my husband, and now he rides to the sunset with the new gf he cheated on the side for 2 years inside the marriage, they both are respected and famous in their  job industry, both have high salary, they also just enjoying life travel the world and only worry about first world problems

Meanhwile my real mom who loved me very much and I love her very much passed away, when she was at her lowest my dad left her to be with my Stepmom, hence she passed away. 

And now I am escaping my abusive husband to the point I am homeless and jobless. 

Life isn't fair and it will never be. Karma doesn't exist, Life goes on and doesn't care. || I feel you man.. that is the reason that could cause us to feel sad sometimes. It is true that people who harm others usually get away, no karma. And bad guys often wins. 

It always break my heart that I see people suffer and I can't do anything; 
while others who aren't affected, is just walk around and be on their way like nothing ever happen. || ♥️♥️♥️

I do wish more people had a much higher level of empathy.

But hey, all the more reason us caring people need to be assertive, have healthy boundaries, and lead by example! 

In my opinion, people who do awful things never truly win. They likely suffer inside or don’t feel much of anything. || Could not agree more. This has actually been on my mind heavily today. 

It’s not about me but I feel like I lost everything while they gained everything. I don’t even know what to say anymore…. All I can do is accept my fate. I can’t change it or even make it better. I just LOST. || I agree wholeheartedly, always have agreed, always will.

The assholes day will come, not sure when, but it will. || I agree with you || This is true. || im right here right now, world sucks || Western society is built off of colonialism and exploitation. Using anger and dominance to overpower other cultures and exploit them. And our cultural wealth has been built off that exploitation. Naturally then, the emotional legacy of using abuse and anger to dominate others remains, and those traits are then still rewarded in our culture. || SO TRUE, and so heartbreaking 😭😭 || True. That's why I mostly just don't interact with people if I don't have to. I no longer go out for leisure anymore. Just work and to buy what I need (and I make it as quick a trip as possible). || I truly no longer believe that bad people will ever see karma. They're blessed and will get everything handed to them in this life and whatever comes after.

I've been so depressed that now I cant even share anything with anyone.,"I've been depressed for the past 5 years and even more so the last three years. This past year I've spent most of my time couped up in my room, procrastinating on everything. Pure nihilism and suicidal ideations. I only go out once or twice a week with one old friend who reaches out. Even then I just pretend. 

Because of this depression I got into religion more to understand things better, with it lots of theology videos and philosophy. Anything to just get me to a new place of thinking.

What happened in turn, (even though I was a lefty) I became agnostic atheist. Now I am even in deeper meaningless-ness. And I can't share this with my family because in thier minds it doesn't need to be that deep. So I just pretend now, it truly is a new kind of aloneness. I am lonely too time to time but it doesnt bother me. 

Im very close to ending it all but what stops me is the pain it will cause my family. But truly if I can't even push myself to do basic things and not be afraid, overwhelmed and flustered what's the point? I could somehow in the past push through it all. But now the responsibility to just live and exist feels too much. 

To get up to shower, to brush my teeth. I did all this in the past because I had to, because external factors like school and work made me do them. But I still felt optimistic about life then. 

Now I wake up and I wish why I hadn't died in my sleep.

"was doing better, now it hits me like a bus","I'm (22F) thinking about to end myself since the 6th grade. Went through some traumatic shit in the past. It's crazy to me, that I'm still alive.

Then, 2 years ago, I thought I found the love of my live. The suicidal thoughts almost vanished for the most of the time. It felt SO good, you can't imagine. Life was FUN. To be mentally well is such a privilege.

For context: Caused by my traumatic past, I became very codependent and I'm very anxious of being abandondent and left alone.

Now I found out, that this relationship was a lie. He doesn't love me. He was my ""lifeboat"" (sound ironic I know haha), and now it feels like I'm drowning. It's like in the past, If not even worse. Every cell in my body want's to die again. The realization, that I will never be truly healthy hurts. I can't live this for longer. And I don't want to.

I wish I was never born,"I've tried. But I am tired. I am tired to wake up every single day, regretting that I did not die in my sleep. Regretting that I have to survive another day while I am already rotting inside. I guess that life doesn't love every person that exists. It would explain tragedies and accidents, and it would explain why some are happy while others suffer. Those lucky enough will be able to enjoy life, but those others will only continue limping towards their true peace.

I was afraid my whole life that I will die alone. That I will be trapped in my own mind with nobody to be there for me. And I guess that this is the only way my life will end no matter what I do. I know people would tell me to only care and think about myself. But I want to be understood too. I can't love myself. No matter how hard I have tried, I cannot bring myself to love me. It's impossible to accomplish when I am aware of the fact that nobody ever loved me either. And if nobody did, why would I? Maybe I am not worth loving. When everyone has the same oppinion on you, then maybe you truly are the problem. So why would you think different?

Though, it does hurt me. I have tried myself to be a good person. I know I wasn't the best, but I wasn't the worst either. I was just human. But for whatever reason, I wasn't treated like a human. Seen as a freak by everyone, abandoned when I was getting attached, isolated from the whole society. My whole existence did not matter to anyone. It was ignored, like a meaningless parasite of the world. How much I have tried to feel like I belong somewhere. Like I found a person that would notice that I am alive too. I didn't ask for love or best friends or a family of my own. Just one single person to notice my existence. To feel like I am alive here as well. But no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up alone in my own thoughts.

I guess that people are right. You can't save everyone. And maybe I wasn't even worth trying to be saved. To be shown that I am human as well. To feel like I am worth something. Like I can do something myself. Maybe in the end, those born as a nobody will forever remain that way. And there is no meaning in trying to change what fate has planned for them.","For me life is hell. Waking up, no friends, no partner, just me and my job I hate.

I want to kill myself just to be at ease and peace,"Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, why these three elements made their home in me. I have been depressed my whole life, even as a child I couldn't live it perfectly coz of our financial situation and sexual harassment. Back then, I just thought this sexual assault is a game so every time that person asked I would go. Didn't engaged in any other activities, didn't make friends, nothing at all. I know no one going to read this long-long story but I don't know why I wanted to write it here and I have no idea what could that obvious reason be, I just wanna do it. 

 
My first depression episode started when I was giving my final 12th exam but it was not that extreme then, when I got in collage, I made some friends who made my depression worst being soo selfish and always make feel left out and some of other things were there too that made me realize all a man wants is sex, not love not anything and it did hit me so hard. I attempted suicide, but then I saw my parents it made me realize this is not an option I have to be strong and make our life better. Without external help I overcame the depression, I worked hard got a good job bought a house for ourselves - finally we didn't have to live in rented house. We were happy and its been 2 years in our new home. 

But as I think I am cursed I cannot be happy for long, My wedding is scheduled in oct and I have no savings, and what more happened? I lost my job. Everything's falling apart. I cannot enjoy the only thing I will experience once in my life, I have bills to pay, EMIs and more imp wedding. The lay off got me so hard, my depression is triggered again and I am harming myself more than ever now. I am not able to see a future so I just want to be dead or sleep all the time so that I don't have to face the reality. It's been 2 months since my lay off, haven't got even a single offer after applying restlessly day and night. Life is tough, I know they are trails, but I just wanted to be happy at my wedding. Most importantly I can cancel the wedding but what about the home I bought for my family, who will give EMIs, everything's fuckedup.  

Since I am not getting any job, I can still save my house but it requires me dead, just want to know what are some tactics to suicide and make it look natural?  ","You mentioned that your parents made you realize that suicide is not an option. Do your parents still motivate you now to keep going? To keep trying? If anything, do it for them. It didn't just have to be that one time. Stay alive for them, but also let them fill with you their love. It's so difficult to bury your own child. 

Also, do you need to get married in October? Can it be post-poned until next year? Because by then you will most likely have found a job and be in a better place, so that way you can truly enjoy your wedding. There's no need to rush, a year goes by so fast! || Yes, I am trying to be here just for them but when I don't have a job I might loose this home, I have a insurance, if I die there wont be anyone paying EMIs, isn't is good? Even if I am not dead I always gonna hurt my self which I do always. 

Also for my wedding, we have been scheduling it from last year, I don't know if other side will agree on that.",1753793642.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcani9/i_want_to_kill_myself_just_to_be_at_ease_and_peace/,depression
Worst low I’ve gotten in a long time,A few months ago one of my brothers had a cancer scare ended up failing one of my classes because of the stress.

A few weeks ago my brother asked my mom to pretty much cut me out of any inheritance (I’m adopted btw) and then compared me to someone who isn’t family. I’ve always considered him my brother and hearing this put me into a full spiral realizing that once my parents pass away I’ll have no family left and that someone I’ve considered family doesn’t even think of me the same. Between the family issues and being conflicted with my relationship that i see no future with I’ve stopped feeling anything. I’m also stressed about school and ending up doing nothing with my life. I have friends however it doesn’t feel like they will really be there like my boyfriend has always been.

How do I get past my greif,"I am an 18m and within the last few weeks I have felt an immense amount of guilt and I have been left feeling stuck in a perpetual state of numbness and confusion. With the help of medical professionals I have been given a Zoloft prescription that I have started taking within the last week. I am disgusted with myself and I want to grow and get past my guilt. I am responsible for the death of my family dog on behalf of my negligence. I regret not being there to care for him. I am sick to my stomach with how careless I was at the time of his passing, I held I’m in my arms when he died, I can’t begin to imagine the way my dog had felt as he passed away. I know that I should learn from my experience and I feel as if I have failed my dog, my family as well as myself. There are a lot more details that I can provide, but currently I’m not in a good position to talk about it fully. My psychiatrist has told me about therapy for PTSD and other traumas but I don’t know about it. What is EMDR therapy? How does it work? How do I grow and learn to forgive myself? I feel stuck in the past event, I feel haunted by him. People in my life keep telling me how it wasn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel responsible. I find myself isolating myself and withdrawing from my family far more than I had done in the past.  I apologize for the writing in this post being all over the place, I am extremly emotional as I write this, reflecting on what has happened. He died on July 9th of this year and at the time of writing this I am still regretful, and I just don’t know how to progress past this point. I can’t stop thinking about him and how I failed him. I’ve been told continuously that I should forgive myself and try to move forward but no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to get past this weight on my shoulders. I’ve been trying to socialize more with my friends to keep myself out of the house and doing more productive things to help cope. I am writing this in hope of finding people who have had a similar experience of feeling overwhelming guilt and I want to know what you’ve done to cope and manage the feelings of numbness, regret, depression, and guilt. Words cannot even begin to describe how I feel. I find myself going through intense waves of guilt and feeling haunted by the loss of my family dog. Knowing that my family still loves me, and knowing that they don’t blame me and forgive me brings me little comfort, I cannot escape my thoughts lately. I want to atleast learn how to manage so I can get into a better mental health state. I can’t stop hearing his barks at night, and I would sob relentlessly but now I find myself being unable to cry and express my feelings. How do I manage grief? Is there any coping mechanisms That you would be willing to share? Do you have a similar experience? I Just need to know that I’m not alone I want to feel alive again, I want to forgive myself. Please tell me of anything that you can share that may help me.",,1753782567.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc77fd/how_do_i_get_past_my_greif/,depression
Not sure what the hell crisis this is I’m going through,"I’m turning 34 in a few weeks and I’m going through possibly the worst episode of depression I’ve yet experienced. This time last year I was satisfied with my life, landed a job I always wanted, finished college, travelled across the US. After that passed and I got settled into my job, I feel flat, unmotivated, depressed, annoyed, lost, unsure about everything. I don’t know who I am anymore. It’s hard for me to feel genuine happiness. Any exciting moments I have are fleeting then it’s right back to feeling sad, unhappy, irritated, uncertain. Last year I had the goal of finally graduating college, I had a big vacation trip planned, and I was thrilled to look forward to starting a new job in a field I loved. 

I guess now that I’ve accomplished those things, there’s nothing to look forward to and life feels mundane. I have went on several small trips throughout this summer and I feel small bits of happiness then it all goes away when I come back home. I haven’t been myself lately and have had to take some time away from work to get my health in order. As I’m home from work I’m questioning everything and wondering what the hell I even went out of my life. I don’t feel like I know anything and nothing makes me happy anymore. 

I started this new job and the realities of it and the strict management has made me feel discouraged from continuing in this field.

Does death matter anymore?,"After almost 2 years with the war in gaza, hearing about death every single day, people getting killed for crime murders, literally almost every week there’s a murder crime in the place i live, i stopped seeing death a big deal,

 i always fantasize about my death, but i know it will only take 1-2 days for people to forget about it .. 
i stopped seeing death as i used to, that scary sad big thing.. It scares me that its the way it is now.. it just proves that life has no meaning too 

In the last week 2 big artists have died (Ziad Alrahbany&Ozzy osbourne) .. but i just didnt feel anything, i feel numb

Depression sucks,I am so tired of being depressed and asking for some kindness only to have people get angry at you or brush you off when all you need is a kind voice and conversation to keep the Demons at bay?

.,"I never had a problem with loneliness. School,college i was fine being alone. Now at 21, I'm in university and all of a sudden i feel this gaping hole in my heart. I just wanted a friend. I just wanted someone to want me. When i found that someone, i mistook their kindness as love. Soon realizing it was a fool's game, i was content with their friendship. But every waking hour is still spent in their memory. I try to set boundaries in my heart between us but cross them nonetheless. Now,even if they dont talk to me or ignore me the slightest, i just break down from within. Im jealous of the way they give their attention to others willingly while i have to beg for it.

I don't understand why I feel this way,"I'm in my 4th year of Law school. I guess it's either the competitiveness, peer pressure or the toxic friend group that I was in from the very beginning that drained me. 

The fact that I'm writing this itself feels unreal to me. It's almost like I don't want to believe that I'm depressed. Or anxious. I get anxious to the point that it affects my speech patterns. My heart races to a point that I can't hear a word anyone's saying and I get nauseous. I'm done with people telling me I need professional help. I know I do. It's just that my parents are conventional minded when it comes to this. 

I don't even feel like going to college. The friend group I was in was weirdly competitive when it came to enrolling in extracurricular activities and they hung out behind my back...like I was shunned...like they didn't wanna be associated with me. And all along I thought I it's becuase I'm weird (Like who wants to associate themselves with a weirdo who's always depressed right?). That's the part that hurt me the most. The fact that I gave up on myself. More than anything else.

(Now I'm in a different friend group where my presence is appreciated and I feel like I'm valued and theirs is all in shambles). 

I don't know why it's hitting me now. My grades have took a huge plunge. I have attendance shortage and what not. 

As they say your environment influences how you behave. I grew up in an environment (My parents are generous and have a helping mentality)  where everyone are givers. My mum I felt like expects getting back atleast 1/10 th of what she gives. My dad is a chill guy tho 😂. As you can see, naturally I inherited their very characteristics. I used to think why they dedicate so much of their energy to people who dgaf about them. (Turns out they're both middle children 😭)

I used to hate their 'giving' mentality. But now...I've become the very thing I hate. And it's taken all my strength to accept the fact that it's not so bad to be a giver. To be like your parents. To not be like your parents. 

To be the side character who gets shuffled to the back of the crowd. To be the one clicks the pictures but never gets clicked. To be alone. To be together. 

I have no idea if people are gonna read this at all. I you did thanks a lot for sticking till the very end ❤️

","Sincere question: What does ""conventional minded"" mean when it comes to getting help?

Also...

>*""I've become the very thing I hate.""*

I'm not sure what you mean by this either. What is it you hate so much? Is it that you rely on your parents' help? Where is this hate coming from? What's wrong with a ""giving mentality?""

Your thoughts are disorganized. You jump from one concept to the next without explaining, so I can see disorganized thoughts are happening here, and I still don't quite understand why help isn't ""conventional.""

You've got a supportive loving family from the sound of it. Can you help me understand this a little more?

Another thing I wonder, were you drinking or using any drugs before typing this? Even cold medicine can sometimes trigger anxiety and disorganize thoughts. Please don't judge yourself too harshly right now.

Is there anyone you can call for help tonight? Anyone in the dorm or near campus who can help you while keeping it confidential?",1753778555.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc66aw/i_dont_understand_why_i_feel_this_way/,depression

Hygiene,"Hey, I’m an incoming freshman for college and I’m struggling with good hygiene habits. I don’t brush my teeth, it’s hard for me to shower. I don’t know what to do. Can someone please give me some motivating tips for it?


Edit: I know it’s gross, and I’m trying to have better habits before I go to college. I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but heavy anxiety. ","There’s an app you can download called Finch. You raise a little animal by completing tasks such as getting out of bed, brushing your teeth, etc. That may help motivate you to do the things you need to for yourself until you can get the motivation. Best of luck in your first year! || I understand it can be really hard to do those things. I struggled with those things my freshman year in college (and at other times) as well. I remember just completely falling apart because I knew I needed to get up, brush my teeth, and wash my face and just couldn’t. So, don’t feel alone.  No judgment. 
Start with one thing. Maybe brushing teeth 1x per day. Choose a time, set an alarm, and brush your teeth at that time no matter what every day or even every other day if every day is too much. 
Building a routine with it helps lift the burden of the task. 
I also use timers for this stuff. Like this morning I was struggling. I set a timer for 5 minutes and told my self when it goes off I would get up, have a snack, take my meds, and shower. 
Small goals and one thing at a time. || Be the best version of yourself, hygiene builds confidence, and people wont be as disgusted to be near you. || If you can keep it up for a couple weeks by forcing it, it will become much easier. I understand when I get depressed those things become hard to get done. || One thing that helped me is taking out a few steps to jump start it. If im struggling to brush my teeth one day, instead of adding the toothpaste, wetting the toothbrush and then brushing for two minutes, I just grab the toothbrush and dry brush for as long as im in the bathroom. If I can’t take a shower, I pick one part and start there. I usually start with my hair since it bothers me the most- i turn on the tub faucet and get my hair wet. Or grab a washcloth and do a quick once over your body. I also buy fun products, interesting toothpaste flavors, fun smelling soap and fluffy towels. Make these hygiene activities fun. 

These small actions are better than nothing. Even if you just dry brush your teeth, you still scraped away some plaque. If you just rinsed yourself off, you’re cleaner than before. Doing these tasks halfway also help give me the push to do it fully. Good luck friend! || I can be tough but honestly reminders can do wonders || I'm with you. But you'll have a reason to shower when classes start and you have to get out every day. Did you have this problem in high school? || Have you tried using timers/alarms/reminders in your phone? Maybe try putting a song or playlist on for self-cleaning time. || I struggle with the same type of thing. I've found that coming up with smaller alternatives to hygiene activities works well for me. If I can't be bothered to brush my teeth, I just do a quick swish of mouthwash. If I can't get myself to take even a quick shower, I use pre-soaped shower towels (they sell them on Amazon, look up rinse free shower wipes). Then some dry shampoo for the non hair washing days. It's small little tasks but it's better than nothing. || All These people Talk about Apps and stuff.
I had the Same Problem Till I Met a Girl. Every Day I reminded me that I Brust my teeth or shower just for her and Even though we broke up soon After because she couldnt let Go of her ex the Habit stayed. I brush my teeth 2 times a Day and Go every two days showering || Thank you! And I have already downloaded the app, I’m thinking it’ll help just a little bit more with raising something and all. || Thank you so much. That’s exactly what I needed to hear. I’m going to try and start small, I got up brushed my teeth, and took my meds. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to stick with it. || Do you have any suggestions for building a better habit? I’ve done that before and it certainly works but I just get into these episodes where everything is so difficult. Lol || I’m going to try and take it slow. I put on a timer on my phone to remind me, and I’ll do it in the shower if I have to. I’m going to get better it’ll be better!! Thank you so much || I love it || Nice work. Proud of you, honestly. || Yea lol, happens before, not sure how to build one, but I just convince myself I like doing those things, I dont like getting in the shower, but like I like the water running through my body. Got anything you like about brushing or showering?

Fool Me,"I recently moved from the US to Spain, hopefully for good, but who knows. Before leaving, my prescription ran out; it was just 50mg of Zoloft, barest therapeutic dose, so why bother renewing, right?

Expressing emotions in the form of writing.,"I believe writing has the potential to reduce your stress, overthinking, anxiety and in turn depression.
Sometimes anonymous writing helps, when you don't want others to know. Sometimes you just post with your public profile.

Is suicide something everyone feels?,"I don’t mean to sound edgy and/or arrogant when I say this

I was playing cards with a few of my friends a few days ago. We were joking around and talking about music. One of my friends asked me if I listened to RadioHead and I half jokingly said “only when I want to kill myself.” Everyone just blankly stared at me, as if I said the craziest thing in the world. I thought I was being relatable and I thought suicide/the urge to not exist anymore was a universal experience. Everyone feels depressed sometimes. Everyone feels anxiety sometimes. Ergo, everyone feels suicidal sometimes. Is this true or am I wrong?","Man, that was funny. Tough crowd.

However I don't think the fact that everyone feels depressed/anxious sometimes necessarily means everyone feels suicidal sometimes. || i feel you. the thought that the average person *isn't* suicidal is mind blowing to me. where is the sunshine and rainbows town and how can I get a citizenship || Good joke, wrong crowd. Some people don’t contemplate mortality. I’ve cracked worse jokes in more serious situations, not funny at them time but pretty damn funny years later. || I don’t think normal people think about suicide sometimes. Radiohead is pretty good tho lol || I'm not sure if it's ""everyone"", but I'd say ""most"" probably isn't too far from the truth.  I think it's also partially why it's so taboo to talk about. || Not everyone feels depressed sometimes, depression is different from sadness, grief, loneliness, stress...

And not everyone who is depressed is suicidal, and those who are can have active of passive suicidal ideation, active means you actually think of killing yourself, when, how; passive means you think you'll be ok falling sleep forever or not existing anymore but don't think about killing yourself. || Yeah not everyone feels suicidal shockingly.
It shocked me too, i would expect everyone to feel it, at least a tiny bit at least ONCE in their life.
Some guy (39m)told me he doesn’t understand why some people feel that way, because he has never felt that way in his life 
That kinda shocked me, since I’ve had this feeling a lot, since 12
(I am now 24f) || but I’m a creeeeeep I’m a weeeeeirdo || kinda valid for radiohead || I used to think this too until I got medicated and curbed my depression. No, most healthy people do not think about killing themselves often enough to make even self deprecating jokes like this. It’s likely they all stared at you because they all secretly worry about you and you likely show more signs of depression than you realize. That’s how it was for me. My depression was actually undiagnosed ADHD. I’m just mentioning it because I’d tried every kind of depression/anxiety medication combination there was and nothing really worked. As soon as I got on Adderall it dissipated. Something docs don’t usually screen for with depression is ADHD. || I think many have thought of in passing however not in the sense of someone with depression would but a thought of how fragile life is. || I think it depends on your circle but people with a healthy childhood usually don’t think about suicide. || I think the majority of people have contemplated suicide at some point in their lives. I don’t think most people actively feel suicidal at any given time, but a lot of people are “meh” on the whole “life” thing, and occasionally think about dying or are passively suicidal in other ways. || There’s been a few times I joked about it because I thought the same thing. Like when Norm Macdonald said “Oh you don’t know about.. life? How it only disappoints?” I guess some people have like.. purpose or something? Or got lucky and experience the ✨mental health✨. Whatever good for them 😊 I’m happy for em an all that. || TLDR. Suicide ideation is not normal, but common on certain scenarios. Seek help Just in case is something deeper. 

A few things that happened during that time 
- mental health stereotypes
- manhood vs mental health
- they catch that as a red flag, in a “call for help” term which made them froze.

Their behavior is understandable, and there’s no point in unraveling  the first 2 points right now.
However your comment. I believe you are maybe talking about “suicide ideation”, at least on a minor scale. Maybe as a joke or not, it is not “normal”. But it is common among certain mental conditions (not necessarily tho). And it is often seen as a red flag for the beginning of something. 

OR maybe you just have a dark humor on that matter. Talking about mental health and suicide is everywhere. So no wonder why we are more prone into either making jokes or having the mental freedom of actually expressing a real concern of yours. || Ha ha, jokes Radiohead is suicide music because they approach difficult subjects with nuance.
Seriously though, listen to Radiohead. It may help your depression || I feel it all the time so it doesn't feel like a big deal. My sister had one vague thought about wanting to give up on life after a rough work week and talks about it in hushed tones like it's extremely taboo and serious. Because even slight thoughts about it IS taboo and serious to people who aren't desensitised to it. || Yeah, when I learned that suicidal thoughts are not something usual to the average person that blew my mind too. I don't even know who I am without these thoughts anymore. || Why didn't anyone else catch it?? || I used to have this perspective. Except I was aware not everyone felt this way to a degree so I only let myself hang out with a crowd that felt the same way I did. Which was not the answer by any means and kept me engaged in one perspective. Just like how you think it's weird how everyone doesnt feel suicidal or depressed sometimes, on the opposite end of the spectrum there are people that think it's weird that there are people who feel suicidal out there because they've never felt that way in their lives and they are afraid to not exist and would live forever if they could. I've been on both sides of the coin, and honestly neither is that great once you take it to the extremes. My current boyfriend is the completely opposite of me in that regards, and im so grateful for him. He gives me life and he is the light of my life. When I feel down, he pulls me back up. I think we all need someone like that in our lives.",1753673922.0,532,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb5wuf/is_suicide_something_everyone_feels/,depression
I thought being attractive would make me happy. It doesn’t.,"   I used to be really skinny and kinda ugly in high school. I never really believed I could have a relationship with a girl, and it didn’t really bother me. I was happy, or at least content, playing video games, drinking beer, and delivering pizzas. 

   Fast forward a few years and I guess I had a bit of a glow up. I started working out and eating better, I started wearing more flattering clothes, and my face changed. I’m not sure how to explain it, but when I look at old photos now, my face definitely looks more grown and handsome now. For the first time in my life, I could be considered fairly attractive. I wasn’t aware of this AT ALL. I guess because it’s hard to notice change when it’s so gradual? 

   So I had this coworker. She was a couple years my junior, and she was so so beautiful. I work with a couple older ladies and they all kinda joke that we would be cute together. I would laugh it off always, still maintaining the old idea that no girl would want to be with me. We were kinda flirty though, and so I thought, ‘what the hell,’ and just asked her out one day. She said yes, and I thought she was just being polite. Again, at this point I had no idea that I’m a pretty good looking guy. 

   So we go see a movie and it goes really well; we made out in the theatre and we were laughing and talking and later I dropped her off. For the next few months we text almost nonstop and we see each other at work all the time. We would meet up at night a few times, but other than that, we almost never saw each other outside of work. This was for reasons I don’t really want to get into. 

   Anyway, I learned during our talks that she always thought I was really hot. I want to reiterate that this girl was beautiful. She was really pretty, had an amazing body, she had a bold but cute personality, she was amazing. When she told me she thought I was hot, it completely changed how I saw myself. 

   We were never really dating, but whatever we had ended. I don’t want to get into the details. Afterwards, I felt fine for a while. I had a new confidence in myself. I saw two other girls in the months following that. It actually surprised me how easily I could meet other girls now. The problem was I couldn’t connect with any of them and I didn’t know why. I stopped seeing the girl I was seeing, and I couldn’t really explain to her why I wanted to end it. I just left. 

   And then this sadness entered my life. Overwhelming, crushing sadness. Like nothing I’d ever felt before, ever. At first it was so intense I didn’t know what to do. I would just ball up in my bed and sob because I literally didn’t know what else to do, the feeling was so awful. 

   I thought this feeling was a symptom of grief for losing the first girl, but it’s been so long. And I still feel like this all the time. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. 

   Fast forward a few months, and now I’m here. I haven’t met anyone new, and I’m not trying to. I’m afraid to. I’ve been trying to understand my emotions better, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed I haven’t really been sad. However, I haven’t been happy either, or angry, or anything. I’ve just kind of felt numb. I think maybe I’ve been bottling up my emotions subconsciously, because the other night I bawled my eyes out for no apparent reason. Nothing really bad happened that day, so I don’t know why I felt like that. 

   Anyways, I just thought writing down my thoughts would maybe make me feel better. Realistically I think I need therapy. I’m not sure if I’m depressed, but I’m trying every day to understand myself better. Peace and love be with you all.

"I dont know, I just needed to put it somewhere else other than in me.","
No matter how hard I try, all my might and grit arent enough stop be from being here.  Its quiet now all the time- i wake up to nothing and I return home to a half life.

Its all gone, the stitching has unfurled.  This hell is sweet; it exists because of love. 

I hate this place. 

I wish for peace. For  rest and for silence, there was a time I tasted pieces of each- but never a full plate.  

Was i ever real?, was anything?, were you?.  

I see proof; screenshots of messages so I wouldnt forget things loved and wanted; I was once among them.

After so much death to have such little light steal itself away from me?- maybe I am the things ive been told.  I know im not all bad- I just dont have the reminder.

The bed is warm and lonley, the kitchen table has four chairs  only one  is ever used.   I sit i wait and watch the sun through the window.  3 months so far- to me you were lost yesterday; I wonder if you could remember me- would you even choose to?.  Am I  cursed to carry another weight forever?, will i withstand and endure the sand filled winds at the edge of that pit or is it to strong finally. 

My heart splintered, parts vanquished and fetitd  full of rot- it isnt a new fact but the taste is getting to me.  

I've buried, pets friends, parents and now I have to find a way to mourn you in some new way. 
 How can i mourn the loss of light when its hard to rememeber its warmth?. 

You gave me hope, you dashed it in a manner of seconds; one decision- years gone never to return.

I miss you, I love you , my sweet girl. ",,1753795963.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcbjvv/i_dont_know_i_just_needed_to_put_it_somewhere/,depression
I kind of tried to kill myself,"Through out my life I've always wanted to disappear, therefore I always had suicide in my mind. I've never really tried, I always did these little things like ""if I have to take 1 pill l'll take 3-4 more, hopefully I die"". Recently I've had more of these thoughts or actions, but I don't really do it because I can't find a ""method"" and I don't want to bring more problems to my family by doing it. 
Yesterday I went to the bath and opened the water, I have had this thought about drowning some days ago, so I just wanted to know how it felt, you know, just another ""I'm not trying to kill myself, but I hope it kind of works ig"" let the water run through the bathtub, then I just lied down in the bathtub and I felt so peaceful, even though I had some thoughts. After I while of waiting I check the water, well, it didn't filled, then I remember my bathtub never worked that well for the bathtub, so we always use the shower. I hoped for the water to not go, I even put my feet in the drain, it didn't work. These days I think a lot about suicide, when I'm about to sleep, in my daily routine, even when I'm at work and I see these high structures. It is not as bad as it sounds, it may been happening for about a week maybe.
Anyways, I just wondered what these kind of thoughts are, or what happened with me, I'm kind of confused.","the main thing in life is to see things through to the end and not to cause inconvenience to others - otherwise no one will take you seriously, even you yourself I hope you understand",1753764286.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc2di6/i_kind_of_tried_to_kill_myself/,depression
jag vill döö,"jepp..... mer eller mindre, jag vill dö.....

jag fungerar inte i vårat samhälle......

Jag har ingen vilja alls, att vara en ekorre som arbetar för någon annan.

eget företag heh den branschen är för tävlingsinriktat.... så där lär jag inte klara av det.  
visst det är bättre att försöka än ge upp....

FUCK, vad jag hatar att jag vart född i en fattig familj, som har skulder.  
Klaga hjälper inte.... enda utvägen är att kämpa, kämpa, kämpa.... och hoppas att jag får tur.... att livet kommer vända....

men sanningen är den livsstil, jag vill leva.... dit kommer man inte på att vara en normal människa.....

hur håller folk ens sig motiverade till att vilja va en ekorre åt någon annan? Det kanske inte känns så för dig...  
Men för mig känns det som att jag är en kossa om jag skulle välja att arbeta, i 08-17 världen.

det är också förståeligt att dom som har arbetat hårt, att komma upp till världen där dom kan anställa folk, att dom inte vill ha folk som är gnälliga och orutinerad och att dom inte kommer, ge belöning åt människor som är lata, det förstår ju vem som helst.

Så ja..... vad är utvägen?  
personligen så hoppas jag att, ja hittar någon rik fru som vill ta hand om mig.

"I don’t want to romanticize Depression, but","I’ve been depressed since I was young. And the past few years has been the best times of my life thanks to my husband. We’ve dated back in high school and rekindled. He helps keep me grounded and reminds me to stay present. He literally knows me in and out. I’m in the healthiest relationship I could ever imagined and he’s so understanding. 

But I always find myself finding comfort in my depression through music or sad things in general to get me in the mood. (Or I just crave it) I know it’s not healthy, but it feels like a security blanket. Odd I know.. I don’t stay in it for long, but a few days in it and I have to remind myself at times to bounce back and I feel better after. 😅. 

In our conversation: him “Do you thrive in depression?”  

Me “I do.. it’s like a drug that runs through my veins..
It has become part of me.”

And I know depression is a silent struggle and how lonely it can get. As humans we still crave human interactions and understanding. 

I’m just wondering if it’s just me or does anyone else find comfort from their depression.

I'm Depressed and don't now what to do?,"So I passed out from Tier-3 Engineering College which is worse than men washroom. There's no teachers/faculties, it's really poor and we can't afford private institutions so well....In that college we have to maintain attendance over 75% even though faculties will be absent more often than students and by faculty I mean guys sitting on examination shell & fee counter.  
I never got that attendance so they never gave me internal marks more than 40/50 it were like 30/50, 31/50, 26/50 and yes below 30, it's internal back for which I need to get least 34 marks out of 100 in externals and well I did not pass Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering in 1st year.  
I got 4 more backs in 2nd year but 3rd and 4th year I focused on progress and got no back although I cleared 2nd year's back.  
now I'm passed out last month, I finished final examination and attended back paper examination for Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering from 1st year and results are out.  
Of course I passed my all 4th year subjects maintaining CGPA over 6 but but but, guess what.

**I FAILED IN BOTH MATHS AND MECHANICAL AGAINNNN!**

Not like I didn't studied dude it's fucking 4th year and I'm poor, I'm stressed for job, I'm busy learning CSE skills for job, I'm busy studying subject I need to and why do I need to pass Basic-Mechanical-Engineering anyway for Software-Developer-Role?

*They gave me like 0.5 or 1 marks on 3-4 page 10 marks answer.*

I can't get degree without it, I'm afraid to tell my parents, I have job pressure already and now I'm depressed.

There's Special Back examination after 3 months but how will I get the money to fill that form?

I got like 26 marks out of 30 where I needed at least 30 to pass the test but they are now laughing at my life wait are they sadist?

Now I'm not sure what to do with my life and thanks for the social media algorithm I'm suddenly getting introduced to those people on the internet who were like get there PhD done when they were 14yrs, those people who solved NASA math for school homework which already making me way too old for my life and I'm getting more and more suicidal thoughts at night.",,1753780993.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc6ste/im_depressed_and_dont_now_what_to_do/,depression

Even when I’m just out and I’m feeling alright I’ll see somthing and be like I’ll remaber that so I can use it to kill myslef with. Or I’ll be talking to someone and my mind will just say “they don’t know I’ll most likely be dead in a couple of years” like it’s always there. I can’t go through a day without thinking about dying. It’s  always there. Sometimes it’s comforting but like tonight it’s keeping my up. 

Most of the times it’s like a background noise but others it’s like it’s shouting at me. There’s nothing I can do about it for a while. I don’t plan on doing anything till I got the right stuff to do it. I’ve had this for a long time so I’ve had a lot of time to plan and research and my result is that the best way to go about this is to OD of course. But that won’t  be till that opportunity shows itself cuz it’s hard to get your hand on the stuff to do it and also I want to try and get to my 25th at lest but my latest will be my 30th (I’m 21).

why does no one get it?,so i decided to open up about my depression to my friends and all they said was ''wtf do u have to worry about?'' and my bsf literally said  'u are a man walk it off'' i wish i was joking but what did i expect from 10th graders,"those people are not your friends. || Privileged people often don't understand other people's struggles. || A bsf telling you to walk it off?
Yeah,no fuck them
You deserve better than that. || I'm assuming you are male based off of the comment your friend made to you (and I apologize if you aren't). It's extremely unfortunate that men's mental health isn't as prioritized as it should be. The stigma that men should just ""walk it off"" or ""grow a pair"" when they are truly struggling in life is not at all fair. These people you call friends don't seem very supportive. I know it's hard at grade 10 to limit interactions or cut ties with people like your friends, but I think it might be a good thing to find people to surround yourself with that are more supportive of you and your mental health. || You really should never expect people who haven't gone through similar struggles to understand how you feel, but yeah, not understandanding and outright invalidating are completely different things. Those people aren't your friends, it seems. || A best friend telling you to walk it off is not a best friend, but I wouldn’t know. I havent had a best friend in years. || So the issue that comes about is people who have not dealt with depression dont understand depression.

Im sure your friends mean well - contrary to every other opinion here - but I agree they arent very supportive. But they're also teenage boys and, having been one many years ago, we kinda all sucked at that, because no one ever taught us and I dont think that has changed in the 30 years since I was a teenager.

Anyway I strayed off the point. People dont get it because they lack the frame of reference. Most people think of depression as ""really sad"". And when people are sad they are generally sad because of something in their life that made them sad, and so they try to think of a root cause but cant find one because they think you've got it pretty good - you've got friends, good family, etc.

So they respond with platitudes, but depression isnt ""really sad"". Depression differs from person to person but it is way, way bigger than ""really sad"" and no one can really understand it without living it or living close to someone with it for a long enough time.

I know it isn't the best, but try to assume they mean well and dont hold it against them.

Life is hard. Depression makes it harder. Just remember youre not alone and there are people who do understand. || You actually need to cut them off I can assure you it will make everything way better I hope this helps || People don’t get it unless they have been trough exactly the same or worse and even then, they might rationalize it or go trough it differently . The new trends of opening up to people , talking to a friend/family are kinda bull because 9/10 times these people just don’t know how to react or what to say or get annoyed at you because they think you have it easier than them or sth (that includes parents who will think oh but at his/her age I was doing so much worse and didn’t have depression and take it as a personal offense if you say you have depression) basically sharing with 90% of people is useless, they won’t make it better and might actually make you feel worse. 

There is only few truly empathetic and caring people that will actually try to be understanding ,  supportive or to try to actually understand what you need or try to think a lot before they give you some bull advice . || i kinda think so too but at the same time they are all that i got || fax || day by day i am detaching and talking less and lesss tbh and thank u for that || yes u guesses right i am a male and i do want to cut ties but they are all that i got that are the most understanding out of everyone and the rest of the guys in my grade are the vapers and talk shit and talk about girls uhmmmm and yeah my options are pretty limited and i rather be alone then make friends with pigs tbh. || No problem, everyone should be expected to be kind

You will get new people in your life who will be much better, you just need to find the right one.
You don't need to necessarily go out to meet new people. Just meet them over social media,games, or whatever you use || I am truly sorry that you are having to go through this. It's been a long time since I was in school, but I remember those days. It wasn't always easy...well, it was almost never easy. Being a kid/teenager is rough. Adults dismissing you and your feelings because how hard can it actually be to be a kid and just have to go to school. And the kids around you don't understand either or don't have the mental capacity to understand things like mental health. Maybe search teen support groups in your area.

is there something inherently wrong with me,"16f. I've never really been much of an introvert (though I try to avoid going out when I can). I make friends pretty easily and I can talk to most people, yet I'm struggling in my relationships. Many of my friends in school have been actively leaving me out of activities and conversations. I feel like an accessory to most groups and my presence feels expendable. I don't get into drama, I don't talk shit about anyone I'm friends with, and I overcompensate by taking on their habits of speaking, humor, and interests so they can like me a bit more. As I went into high school, I molded myself to become more appealing to people and I made a lot of friends, yet all that effort feels ultimately futile. I don't belong anywhere I go, not since the day I was born. I'm the black sheep of my family (yes, even as an only child), the stain in my friend groups, and the one floater everybody goes to when their ""actual"" friends can be with them. I only have one really good friend, but she lives in a different state. Even then, she always talks about how close she is with her boyfriend and other best friends and I can't help but feel worse and even lonelier.

Even simple interactions with people are tiresome and trite. Every conversation I have with people feels like small talk. I don't enjoy anything. I try so hard, but I can't feel fulfilled by any conversation I have with them. It feels like time dilates, and I can feel my mind materialize and piece together huge rifts between me and everybody else. I'm missing something that makes them click--something that I don't have.

A lot of this has manifested into deep insecurities about my own faculties. I feel much less accomplished, talented, pretty, intelligent, witty, and charismatic than everybody else around me. I feel like a shell of a human being with no outstanding traits. I have my own interests, my own identity, and a good idea as my standing as a human being--yet I can't help but feel inadequate/emptier to everybody else. Talents I thought I had, and a vision for a future that I manifested for so long, seem to be slipping through my fingers like an inviscid liquid. I feel like nothing, I feel like I am a nobody. I can't achieve anything.

I don't like feeling this way. I don't know what to do. My therapist, my parents, and my best friend don't understand me and they don't give me any solutions or steps. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just a naturally a socially inept person? My mom and dad say I'm incredibly sarcastic wording on rude, but that's how a lot of my ""friends"" at school talk to me too. Or it is just my lack of admirable traits?

One of those nights,"
I feel like every other day I’m having like this weird reality check that this is my life. That I’m really a 24 year old with a dead mom and a father that’s never been in my life . Which at this point I truly don’t know even know if he’s alive. Like I can’t believe there is someone on this earth that I came from that wants nothing to do with me that I wouldn’t recognize if I passed by them, a complete stranger. It makes you wonder if my own father doesn’t even want me who would? Is this normal? was this something I was supposed to normalize and pretend like I can still have a good life . When I feel so isolated from literally every other human being. I feel so disconnected. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. When I’m working I feel responsible like an adult. When I’m distracted. When I have time to breathe I feel like a lost child. When I have time to take In my reality I’d rather be anywhere else than in my own body. I’m extremely delayed it’s like I’m always this 15 year old. No confidence , wanting to go unnoticed but be seen as “normal” embarrassed of my family dynamic. Never feeling like I’m valuable, likable enough. Then I get older and older and before I know it I’ll be 48 still feeling like that 15 year old. My mom died at 48 I hope I die sooner. I don’t have anything to do here but suffer. To be used and get nothing in return. Just feeling like the 15 year old that no wanted after mom died . Now I’m the 24 year old that people still don’t want.

"Went back on Prozac, feel unmotivated and awful about how my life is going (RANT)","This is more of a rant post. I feel like not a lot of people in my life really get what I'm going through. 

Like they know what depression's like, but not clinical. The type where nothing has to happen, or a small disturbance can trigger it. I've been depressed since I was 8, I'm 21 now. I didn't know at the time that I had depression, but I can look back on it and confirm that I did have it. 

I was bullied a lot growing up, I moved to 8 schools probably more in my childhood. I was isolated from others in 4 schools, bullied in 4 schools. From family, teachers, people who I thought were my friends, classmates, and just random people. I was always the target of someone's aggression. I stayed inside most of my childhood, maladaptive daydreaming to avoid the real world. My mom was a single mom, she worked two jobs most of my life and when I was 13 she started going to school and working. So in both instances, I didn't see her much. So on most days I was alone, or being 'babysat' by a relative, but really I would just go in my room and only come out when it was time to eat. I'd spend days being mute, not talking to anyone besides a ""hi"" to my relative(s) or my mom. In school, I would go days without saying anything because I couldn't relate to them, nobody made me feel safe. My muteness got better, I was able to be more social from middle school to high school. But I still had problems at school and was maladaptive daydreaming to cope with it. I was verbally, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused growing up. I was blackmailed into having sex with a boy who I thought was my friend for 1 year. It really messed me up. I was exploited only by pedophiles as a child online. I just wanted love. So I showed my body a lot when I was 12 - 18. Even though I didn't like the sex, and in all honesty, I do think I'm a lesbian, I thought that was the only way people could love me. Because I felt so ugly in school, the majority of the schools I went to, I was told I was ugly. I struggle so much with my weight now because I don't want to go back to being 'ugly' again. I've crash-dieted many times, my worth was tied to a scale for many years. 

  
I dropped out in my senior year of high school because I couldn't take the bullying anymore and got my GED. I went to college with a bang, made friends, lost a lot of weight, had a boyfriend, and was doing good in college. Everything was going great until it wasn't. I lost all those friends, gained weight, my ex-boyfriend was sexually abusive, and I have no drive to complete my education. I'm only still here because I'm a senior in college, and the political state of the world makes me feel I would be screwing myself over if I take a gap year or pursue a job not related to my major.

The depression I felt doubled in April. I don't know what came over me. I left the gym, and something told me to just start driving really fast, so I did. I was passing a lot of people and speeding, passing people over solid lines. For the first time in almost a year, I'd felt adrenaline. A high that I missed so much that I kept passing people and driving erratically despite knowing I should stop. I had a green light, and a guy was turning left, thinking only he had the green. I was going too fast to react, so all I could do was slam on the brakes. He crashed right into my driver's side. Nobody died; I had minor injuries. But I felt so shitty. The people who crashed into me kept yelling at me that they had a green light and that they had a dashcam, the mother of the driver shoved a camera/or dashcam Idk what it was, in my face when I was at the hospital. Overall just being really aggressive and not helping the situation. And a witness decided they wanted to come forward about my reckless driving before the accident, even though he admitted that he did not see the accident happen. My mom is in debt due to the accident. My car was totaled. She already works day and night, and I gave her more trouble because of this ""feeling"" or ""adrenaline"". I don't have a car. I feel like a failure in life on most days. 

I was on Prozac in May, and went off because I ran out of medication. I stayed off because I hated the side effects from the Prozac, like the low motivation and suicidal ideation. And in general, didn't have the motivation to go and get the medicine. I don't know why I just kept pushing it off. I only took it this time around because my mom said she wouldn't let me drive since I'm not taking my medication and that I'm a danger to myself and others on the road. I got the prozac yesterday, and since taking it I have such low motivation. I only had enough strength to cook myself breakfast, I've just been sitting and laying down in silence all day. I often space out and think about how sad my life was for hours on end.

On a lot of days, I think of just ending my life. I didn't have a childhood; I barely had a young adulthood. Is this what life has to offer me? I'll get a job after I graduate, and then what? Work for the rest of my life? That doesn't sound appealing to me. But I don't exactly have the funds or resources to go and live in the woods comfortably away from everyone. I have a promising career in psychology as a researcher. I've been told this many times by many different people. But I wish they'd just forget I existed and give that opportunity to someone else, because then I wouldn't feel guilty turning it down. I'm not in the best mindset to make decisions, which is why I've just been going along with what people are telling me to do now. Because if it were up to me, my life would be worse off.",,1753790623.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc9kka/went_back_on_prozac_feel_unmotivated_and_awful/,depression
Struggling rn,"I am a child abuse survivor. My parents had substance use issues as well as depressive tendencies. I was basically ignored or abused my whole childhood. I have adhd and didn't get the support I needed so I didn't do well in school. My older sister was the one they wanted.  

I basically planned to cut them out of my life since I was 6. I moved out, got my life together, managed to start a career and found a way to survive when I thought that would be impossible for someone like me. I'm married to a guy that treats me well and though our relationship isn't perfect, when we have problems he's on my team and willing to work on it with me. No kids, I didn't want any, then he didn't want any, now we're both considering it but circumstances and finances scare us. I spent a lot of my childhood lonely and friendless. But I even have friends now that I see every weekend.  

My grandpa passed and left me enough money to get a down payment on a house. A stable safe home was what I dreamed of having someday. It's what kept me pushing forward through all the hard times and academic bullshit. Interest rates are high but with our combined income we can make our mortgage payments. I work two jobs. Husbands job is really nice and pays for our health insurance.  

But it feels like something inside me broke once I got what I wanted more than anything in life. I have a house, but I'm not happy. I feel empty. Times are uncertain and I may get laid off, and in our city the major employer is letting people go. I've been trying to find a better job already so I don't have to work 2, but it's been a year, 3 interviews and nothing. I'm unsure if the skills I have are good enough now that there's ai. I'm so tired now. It makes me wonder what is the point? If this all wasn't enough for me, why am I trying so hard? Will I ever be happy?  

I can feel my therapist getting frustrated with me. She's seen me pull through worse stuff than this without feeling hopeless. But back then I had my dream home to look forward to someday at the end of it all. And I feel lost and directionless now that I have it and I feel less certain of my future than ever. I know I did all those things to get here. I should be resilient enough to survive whatever happens in life and I know that any life I make for myself could be a good one. But that part of me feels so far away. Like I can't be that anymore.

I don’t want to attend my sister’s wedding….,"Growing up, my mother always seemed to favor my older sister over me and my other sister. From the way my older sister was treated compared to us, it was easy to think that she was better in every way and was destined for great things. She always excelled in school and the arts. She has a lot of friends and is undeniably the most beautiful out of all the siblings. I hate to admit it, but it always hurt me to see her succeed. It’s always seemed like she’s living life on easy mode. I’ve seen her have her moments, but she bounces back so quickly. And she never had a problem getting a man. Me, on the other hand, have had the worst luck in love. 

There was no doubt in my mind she would find somebody. Of course it ended up being a handsome 23 year old with a successful career. She met him when she moved to Ohio for school and the rest is history. I always hated when she’d come to visit because it constantly reminded me that I had nobody. I don’t hate my sister, I just hate that she has everything I want: a thriving school life, large group of loyal friends, the perfect boyfriend. 

I hate that I do this when I’m emotional, but in my moments of breaking down, I often wished she would eventually end up single again like me so I wouldn’t feel so ashamed that I didn’t have anybody. Well, recently they got engaged, and I locked myself in my room and cried until I was blind from rage/distress. 

Everyone in my family is gushing about their wedding plans and how magical it’s going to be, while I’m dreading when that day comes in about a year. I don’t want to be there, not because I have any ill will towards her or her boyfriend, but because I don’t want to ruin her special day by being a depressed and miserable wreck. 

I know she probably wants me there for support, but I can’t help but think I’ll be a burden. I just couldn’t handle it. She deserves to have a stress free day. I’ll just stay home and get drunk I guess. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my sister. I just don’t understand why it seems like everything goes right for her and my life has just been me constantly contemplating suicide. ",,1753758821.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc0n4q/i_dont_want_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/,depression

"hi. i hate myself, and want to die.","i've self-harmed since i was 14. i don't remember why i started. i think i've just always hated myself. the way i look, sound, act. 

i've never had big family issues. a few fights with my grandfather, but i always respected him. when i still lived with them, my older sibling never learned how to drive so i was stuck driving them to school when my dad wasn't able to, limiting time i could spend working or just doing other things - that was pretty annoying. even now they bother me a lot with tech advice they would be better off just looking up, and they always ask at the worst times like when i'm really busy at work. i feel bad for thinking of them as useless at times, since i know they've dealt with similar mental struggles, but i can't help it. anyway, it didn't help - but wasn't the instigator since that was well after i started cutting myself anyway.

i was pretty good in school until the end of high school. at that point i felt pretty committed to being a content creator, so i was just trying to graduate and move on. barely did, and moved onto community college - dropped out after two years. went okay for a bit, but eventually my motivation completely died, started failing classes and eventually just stopped going entirely. self-harm only got worse throughout. content creation never worked out, but that's fine - it sounds like a miserable job nowadays anyway.

my first job was working a small gas station for a grocery store. somehow, i hated it. it'd be 8 hours to myself, not doing much for the most part. i'd bring my switch and played a lot of fire emblem and animal crossing. it should've been fine, should've been easy, but i somehow found a way to make it worse. i hated whenever people payed with anything but a card, for some reason - despite only taking a few seconds to deal with them. i don't understand why, but it made me so angry. maybe it was because i had brought a game to play, and they were ""taking me away from it,"" despite it being my job. i don't know. brains fucked. still did that for 6 years though, for some reason. somewhere in that time i started to burn myself alongside cutting myself plenty.

not gonna say what i do now, but it is a lot better. my boss can be pretty stubborn and stupid sometimes, and that's leading to a lot of stress right now. for a few years i didn't cut myself as much, just every few months i'd go a bit crazy to let it all out. i think the recent stress is really getting to me cause i'm back to cutting/burning every day, but oh well.

i still hate myself. i still think about killing myself all the time. i'm surprised none of my wounds have ever gottten infected, since i do next to nothing to actually treat them. some of my roomates know about this, but they haven't said anything about it in years. they were only ever really aware because of a vent twitter i had, but i deleted that ages ago - so from their perspective, everything is probably fine now. i always feel like i'm just one really bad day away from offing myself.

writing this, my life really hasn't seemed that bad - and that just makes me feel worse for all this. other people have had it so much worse, and here i am with a generally pretty good life making the worst decisions possible. guess i'm just a naturally useless piece of shit, huh?",,1753768478.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3kzs/hi_i_hate_myself_and_want_to_die/,depression
got into clinic for adults as a 19 year old,"After waiting forever, I got a spot in a psychosomatic clinic today, starting in two months. However, I only turned 19 and originally wanted to get into a clinic for young people (under 25) and am now kinda scared, I don’t feel adult and feel 1000 times more comfortable around people my age, I’m basically still a teenager. I mean, I was at least hoping to feel comfortable there and maybe talk with someone my age but now there might just be people over 40 or 50 there. They’re people who probably already got a job, and already raised kids my age so we definitely won’t be on the same wavelength, and I’m scared they’ll look down onto my struggles(say something like I haven’t experienced adult life and it will only get actually bad in the future, and I have nothing to be depressed about and basically invalidate my feelings). And I heard that even if the clinic is bad, it’s the people that can make the stay not so bad, I was hoping to maybe even make some friends, but what if they’re all twice my age or more, I don’t think I’ll be getting along with them much. Especially since I’ve got quite a lot of trauma from my parents, so I feel highly uncomfortable around people their age.","thats valid. try to be open about it with the hospital staff and doctors. they will understand and know ways to make it better for you. also for me i can say that very often the things i fear dont actually happen. theres no way to know how you will feel when youre actually in the situation. we make up scary scenarios in our heads just in case. bcuz our brains like the illusion of control. but its pretty pointless a alot of the time. i know u cant press a button and make the thoughts go away but it actually helped me to realize that it does nothing but stress me even more. its like whatever happens happens wether u overthink it first or not. so for me what rlly helped is affirmations, something like: this clinic is a safe place. the people there are literally there to help you.
what i learned in hospital is that thinking about things is what gives fears power over u in the first place. so try to think as little as possible and focus on the present moment by paying attention to ur surroundings. they will also teach you that there. its that whole mindfulness approach. anyway ive been in institutions like that a bunch of times and from my experience, younger and older people often get along rlly well! ive never witnessed anyone being looked down on for what they were going through. mental patients are usually very friendly and empathetic. everyone there knows what its like to struggle. and its a place where youre allowed to be in whatever mental state youre in. they will understand. ah i just remembered something else that helped me. instead of thinking what could go wrong think of what could go right. yes, maybe it’ll suck there but maybe it wont yk. like chances are there will be other people ur age. maybe your therapist will be amazing. all u can do and all u _have to_ do is be open minded and give it a genuine chance. youre gonna be okay somehow.",1753775708.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc5gl1/got_into_clinic_for_adults_as_a_19_year_old/,depression

Being sick is incredibly isolating,"My (21m) depression skyrockets when I'm sick. Maybe this is just a me thing but getting sick just tanks my mental state and makes me way more emotional than normal. It's just such a crushing feeling, wanting to use ur body but ur too weak to move it, wanting to use your voice but it's painful to speak, wanting to be near someone but being avoided because who knows if it's contagious?

Any suggestion on not relapsing back to depressed phase?,Work had been the only routine thing that somehow kept me going. But I broke my ankle and I really hate myself for it because I cannot work for up to 2 months. I'm actually afraid of getting into more debt (already struggling with 100K debt since 2018) and possibly getting evicted for not being able to pay rent. I started to think about ending myself again and it's kinda scary knowing I have access to firearm. Well actually I originally bought a handgun to end misery back in 2021 when panic attack went out of control and nobody helped at the ER etc. I've been trying my best to keep negative thoughts at bay. But I don't know how long I can hold. I've been dealing with passive s*icidal ideation for many years and it's keep coming back during difficult moments (usually financial related). I can't afford to go back to women homeless shelter. I'd rather die if worst case scenario happen. I'm already worried about losing my job even though the HR said I'll be ok as long as I submit medical documents (can't really trust them 100%). I'm trying to stay positive but my brain simply can't.

It’s been so long since I rant my emotion,"hey, I haven’t had any emotional distress or depression since I left my uni to do my internship. 6 months passed and today, it just happened :)

Sometimes I wonder if I’m the only person who gives energy to my friends. Whenever they rant or anything, I would always reply. But no one do the same for me. It kind of triggered me today and I just felt helpless.

It also doesn’t help for a fact that in my internship office, the interns dont share what are they talking about. I just feel stressed today

How do I help my partner?,"Hi there (I'm using a throwaway account because my partner uses reddit and we follow each other, I don't want him to see this. I'm not a bot, I promise). I am looking for advice/stories/experiences/really any insight from anybody who has been in a similar situation, on either side. 

 
I (mid 20's F) have been with my partner (early 30's, M) for about 3 years now, and we've known each other for around 5-6 years total. We both have our own struggles with mental health, which we have both made steps to improve over the years. I am in a fairly good place, my depression tends to be cyclical, with a bad week coming up every couple of months or so, but I'm doing much better than I used to be. We just moved into a new rental house, which is the most space we've had in years. I have part-time job while also studying from home full-time as I work towards my Bachelor's degree. 


My partner hasn't had a steady job in the past 2-3 years. His mental health ruined his previous employment, and he has done a pre-trade course but has been unable to land a job in that industry, (not for a lack of trying on his part). He has hit a bit of a slump in the past 6 months or so. He was doing well for a while, motivated to learn and grow his skill set, and expand on his hobbies and interests, which he spends a good chunk of his time doing. But that motivation has faded. 


I want to make it clear that his lack of employment is not an issue for me, he pays his half of the rent and all of the bills, and I don't believe having a job is a big indicator of someone's personality, worth, or drive. 


My issue is that I don't know how to help him. I take care of the house, and the groceries, and planning dates and outings, on top of working and studying and caring for my parents and maintaining my social relationships. It's a lot. 


And it hurts. My heart hurts all the time because I can see he's in pain. I try to be there for him to lean on and talk to as much as I can, and he does talk about it. But I hear about how useless he feels, and how sad and full of despair and self-hatred he is. And it hurts so much. I don't know what to do. 


He is in therapy, he is on medication (has a review coming up to potentially up the dosage or explore new options), he is trying. I see him trying so hard and he feels like he's getting nowhere and I don't know how to help. I don't know how to make it better, or even stop it getting worse. 


He doesn't take it out on me, he tells me often how much he loves and appreciates me and everything I do, and he's there for me whenever I need or want anything at all. 


But I can't take away his pain, and that's all I want to do. Every day I see the person I love suffering, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. 


I feel useless, frustrated, angry at the world and the situation we find ourselves in. I'm so sad and so tired all of the time, but I keep going because I can't be the reason this all falls apart. I can't give him another reason why everything sucks. 

Before anyone suggests it, I am not going to leave him. He's been there for me when I was falling apart, and I'm going to do the same for him. 


I just need someone to tell me it's going to be okay, tell me how things got better for you, or what you found that made any sort of difference. Please tell me. Thank you.

I need help,"I keep having dreams of committing suicide. I have a regret of telling my friends and my mother that I am depressed, therapy doesn't work, I'm convinced I've gotten so used to my meds that they don't work anymore, my friends think it's cowardice to commit suicide despite the fact that I've told them about wanting to try it. Not to mention the one and only person that I've told my struggles to, as great as he is, I feel a level of regret telling him as well. He hasn't done anything bad but I'm not the type to talk about how I feel to people. Last night I had a dream that I was in my kitchen and I had a gun pointed to my head, everyone I knew was trying to stop me from pulling the trigger, but I did anyways. Part of me wishes it was a reality, minus the part where everyone I knew tried to stop me, I don't want to be stopped honestly, I wish it was a real thing that happened. I die, I don't want a funeral, nor be cremated, just let me rot by myself.

I am at my lowest,"I (M15) am at my lowest ever right now. I know that some people will say that cant be true because I am still Young but in the last time Happend so much shit that I cant comprehend.
At the begining of the Summer holydays I went to a Party with some of my Friends and my girlfriend. She lives in another Country so I dont See her often, but she was at her Friends House this time(one of my Friends). At the Party we were pretty drunk and we kissed and made out.

A week later my sister turned 18 and invited her and my Friends to her Party. I thought this Would be just another Nice Party where me and my gf has some fun, but when she was there she did Not even look at me. 3 Hours in I realised that she did Not want anything to do with me anymore which my Friends confirmed. 
I then downed Shot After Shot and quicly became so drunk that I couldnt read anything because it was so blurry. After some time doing this she came up to me and Said that she was sorry for that and that she did Not feel anything while Kissing and making out. So that is how She broke up with me. 

Around this Moment a colleague from work came by, who I was good with and we talked for a Bit.
I have a very pretty friend but she is in my class so I Would Never Date her(the one my gf is staying). But she Loves to Party and Drink. The Problem is she always Drinks so much that she is Not able to realise what is happening and so she cannot defend herself from people who want to touch her. She also does Not remember anything the next Day when she is drunk.
My colleague knows this and just focused on her.
Because I was to drunk to protect her from him he used his Chance to take her with him somewhere and rape her. 

And now I make myself alligations that it was all my fault and I should have been able to protect her. 
Because of These two things I am now Highlight depressed and am thinking to end my life.

"25F, burned out with no desire to try anymore.","Hi all. As the title says, I’m a 25F, with barely any motivation to keep on keeping on. I was a gifted kid. Always had energy & motivation to work hard in school. Played on competitive sports teams all throughout middle school & high-school. Went to college, got my Bachelor’s like I was supposed to. Only for my first job to drain the ever-living fuck out of me. Got a new mostly remote job (in accounting), and I still feel the effects. I work from home 4/5 days/week which is great, but the job itself is already overwhelming. Actually, everything else outside of this job feels overwhelming. I no longer want to socialize on the weekends. I’m far too mentally drained to socialize during the weekdays so I mostly self-isolate now. I used to love working out, and now I haven’t seen a gym in years. I’ve gotten to the point where pretty much everything feels pointless. As a result, I’ve become extremely lazy and disorganized, and the only time I feel relieved from stress is when I drink, which is pretty much everyday now. All I do on the weekends is stay at home & sleep and drink with my boyfriend. I feel awful about this, because he suggests things we could do, but all I want to do is stay in bed with him. He deserves better.

Logically, I know I should just get a new job or switch careers, but even that feels exhausting right now, especially with how the job market is. Even if I did, I’m starting to feel like the whole 9-5 corporate bullshit just isn’t for me. Life has to be more than staring at a screen for 40 hours/week. I have no passion for anything anymore. Week by week, the feeling just gets worse. While I would never end it (can’t hurt my loved ones), at night I’ve started to pray for the universe/god to take me in my sleep because then I would truly be at peace. I genuinely don’t know how to fix this, because this tiredness isn’t something that sleep can fix and trust me, I’ve tried. I don’t know where to go from here, because I want to get better and love life again, but it’s like my mind & body won’t let me.

"I get suicidal depressed when i orgasm, why?","It's worse when I masturbate, I can get panic attacks and get seriously suicidal, but it was uncomfortable even when I was with my ex, to the point I stopped orgasming when having sex, I would hold myself back whenever I could and feel seriously disappointed when I couldn't hold myself back..

This has been going on for a lot of time, probably since the first time I masturbated, but the link has been clear only lately.. I had an amazing month, I masturbated one time and I got suicidal back again. I found out that with porn is worse, but it's bad even without it. With sex sometimes is fine, usually is not.

I think it can be tied to PTSD? Pheraps sexual trauma I don't remember? I have definitely abandonment trauma tho.
I can't really enjoy my sexuality most of the times. Sometimes it is fine, but most of the times it is like that..

No therapist have ever given me a clear answer on that, nor real solution, when I feel generally better that gets better as well, but I don't know the cause nor if there's a solution.","I thought I was the only one.

It’s seems enticing in the moment but just makes things worse after. || I used to suffer from that, now it's more controlled. Mine was a mixture of growing up Catholic and EVERYTHING sexual was a sin. Along with the hormones, the extreme high of climaxing to 'normal' levels is very sudden. I got better by understanding sex is healthy and natural. But the sudden change in hormones is still there. || My guess is the Swidden decrease in whatever chemicals are released in the euphoria || Hey. This happens to me as well but I know the cause. I am a csa survivor and have always had memories of it and wish I didn’t. It doesn’t mean that’s what happened you. Abandonment struggles could be it.

I also suffer from it, whether I climax or not. It's similar to a sub drop from what I understand, & I've had the best recovery from it when it's treated the same. Basically, your body gets to a really high high, but that's not sustainable, & when the pleasure causing that high stops, the chemicals drop back down to normal levels.

It may be worth contacting a specialist who works specifically with psychosomatics or sexual trauma. Even if there were no clear answers before, this does not mean that they do not exist || There could be several reasons for that, including the prolactin hormone release after inducing orgasm.

"Мне 18, и я не хочу больше существовать","впервые выскажу всё что копилось на душе годами, наверное глупо это делать здесь, но не думаю что кому-то из моих знакомых это надо. я родилась в достаточно бедной по сегодняшним меркам семье, не то чтобы у нас не было на еду, наоборот, всего необходимого в достатке, но что-то дорогое никогда не могли себе позволить, к примеру поездку на море даже в нашей стране. изначально в нашей семье кроме меня была бабушка и моя мама, отец умер через несколько месяцев после того как мне исполнился год. мама в скоре попала в аварию и стала инвалидом второй группы, ей приписали ревматоидный артрит из-за чего она постоянно нахрамывала, со временем от постоянного приема разных медикаментов её здоровье начало ухудшаться, камни в желчном, сердце, проблемы с желудком и печенью, катаракта на обоих глазах, да я даже не помню всего что у неё сейчас есть. но вернёмся к детству, по приходу в садик я поняла что как-то отличаюсь от остальных детей, которых приводили и забирали мама с папой, поскольку у меня это была только бабушка, на всех мероприятиях в дет.саде тоже была только она, я смотрела на других детей которые радовались при виде своих родителей и не понимала почему у меня не так, что со мной не так. несомненно я тоже радовалась когда видела бабушку, но это другое ощущение, ведь так? они радостно прыгали папе на руки, мама целовала их в щёку, а меня просто забирали, без всего этого. зимой после сада мы шли на остановку и ждали автобус часа полтора, когда было теплее туда и обратно добирались на велике. а приходя домой я видела маму скажем так, изуродованную. тело не могло выглядеть на её возраст, поэтому в 35 она выглядела на 50 и так далее. всегда завидовала детям у которых здоровые и красивые мамы, с которыми они могут побеситься или к примеру съездить куда нибудь. конечно у меня есть уважение к своей матери, но люблю ли я её? не думаю. время от времени меня могли бить если я сильно где-то напартачу, а если при этом я начинала плакать говорили не делать этого иначе ещё и за слёзы добавят. каждый вечер мама с бабушкой ссорились на кухне и каждый раз всё начиналось с ничего, каждый вечер они повторяли одни и те же фразы, настолько что я могу пересказать дословно все их ссоры. и вот мне 12, мы живём на минималку в Украине, в доме где не проведена вода и опадает глина с потолка оттого что крыша протекает и она размокает. я уже полностью поняла что моя семья отличается от всех остальных, я стыжусь своей матери и своих условий, не привожу домой друзей чтобы все думали что у меня всё так у других. я не выросла ребеноком паинькой, наоборот, если мне что-то запрещали, делала на зло та и вообще мои подростковые годы прошли в постоянном бунте, поскольку меня всегда опекали, если я задерживалась с друзьями на улице бабушка шла и забирала меня домой под предлогом что они переживают, при этом я гуляла в селе в нескольких домах от моего. после каждого такого раза я устраивала скандал, мол что я сама разберусь до скольки мне гулять. в школе у меня была подруга к которой я ездила на ночёвки и могла проводить там недели, я точно знала что её родители не против этого, поскольку она жила в селе где было пять домов и во всех были пенсионеры, они хотели чтобы их дочь проводила время с одногодками не только в школьные будни. мне могли звонить раз 50 за день, на что я просто отключала телефон, оттуда ведь она меня всё равно не заберёт поскольку не знает где это. а у этой подруги назовем её Лера были достаточно молодые родители, было то о чем я всегда мечтала и в те моменты когда я могла как-то по детски баловаться вместе с ней с её отцом были для меня чем-то новым, чем-то что приносит тепло и одновременно режет сердце. дома же после каждой такой поездки меня ждал грандиозный скандал, мать всегда говорила что она переживает, что ей плохо от этих переживаний, мол я хочу довести её до смерти. и когда-то в детстве я за что-то очень разозлилась на мать, когда она кричала на меня я в порыве гнева сказала ей «мне не нужна мать которая лазит» конечно это ударило по ней, услышать такое от своего ребенка это ужас. и вот почти каждый такой грандиозный скандал она напоминала мне об этом, несмотря на то что я тысячу раз извинилась за это, несмотря что прошло уже много лет, говорила что я наверняка хочу такую мать как у Леры и если так то я могу идти обратно туда, мне ничего не оставалось как всё отрицать, но она была права. позже Лера переехала в город и я тесно общалась с другой девочкой назовем её Диана. в то же время бабушка начала постепенно сходить с ума, сначала это было что-то мелкое, мол забыла куда положила деньги, телефон и всякие мелочи, постепенно это превращалось в забыла куда шла или же своё имя. у меня постоянно пропадали вещи которые она брала от чего я бесилась ещё сильнее, у неё была привычка перекладывать их либо же вообще выносить во двор в сарай, вроде бы ничего такого, но когда ты живёшь в постоянном хаосе, где не можешь элементарно найти свою одежду или предметы гигиены начинает действительно постепенно ехать крыша. мать же будто бы не понимала что бабушка психологически больна, она продолжала с ней ссориться, продолжала винить во всём меня или её. от постоянного какого-то стресса либо психологического давления я начинала быть всё агрессивнее, но что мать что бабушка могли сесть напротив меня и часами говорить обо мне всякий бред. мне бы было ещё нормально если бы не последнее, всю обиду и злость копившуюся во мне я могла выместить физически, разбить что-то или ударить их же, в эти моменты я будто себя не ощущала и не понимала что делаю. после этого приходя в себя я убегала куда-то подальше и ревела сожалея о содеянном. и всё же я нашла другой способ, я начала заниматься селфхармом. годы шли, порезов на мне было всё больше и больше, бабушке становилось всё хуже, она переставала узнавать меня, переставала понимать где находится, часто несла всякий бред будто она сейчас находится в больнице, а не в родном доме, могла пойти куда-то, по её словам домой после чего мне приходилось её искать и молиться чтобы меня никто не увидел рядом с ней, иногда могла быть агрессивной, взять нож и кричать чтобы мы её не трогали иначе зарежет. но мама и дядя (дочь и сын моей бабушки) будто игнорировали тот факт что ей нужно лечение, причем что у дяди были возможности свозить её хотя бы на осмотр. матери же нужно было куча операций, из них она сделала только две, большая часть денег и так уходила на её пожизненные лекарства без которых она не смогла бы двигаться. и вот мне 16 на тот момент я встречалась с парнем уже полтора года, даже впустила к себе домой и соответственно была уже не девственницей, я отдалась чтобы почувствовать себя нужной и любимой. и в этом возрасте происходит полностью переломный момент, бабушке резко становится хуже, она становится лежачей и ухаживать за ней приходится мне, она кричит целыми днями и ночами о смерти, мне приходится убирать естественные отходы иногда поднимать её на постель если она с неё падала. мы с мамой не могли есть и спать поскольку в этом ритме с постоянными криками спать было невозможно и сил чтобы даже встать с кровати не было. бабушке начали давать снотворные, но даже самые сильные помогали лишь на несколько часов после чего всё начиналось заново, в доме стоял резкий запах, хоть я и вымывала всё, полностью вывести его было невозможно, иногда мне приходилось через силу готовить для нас, хоть я уже сама понемногу сходила с ума, мне 16 и на мне два инвалида, это правда страшно. дядя же не хотел её забирать или же как-то помочь мне, он только делал вид что переживает, иногда привозил лекарства и проведывал бабушку говоря что я плохая хозяйка. мне же эти три часа сна снились только кошмары, начало что-то казаться в темноте, но об этом я никому не говорила, вдруг в психушку отправят. я жаловалась своему парню на что он пытался как-то меня подбодрить, но я достаточно распробовала вкус жизни и говорила ему что всё что он говорит не работает и такого не будет, на что он злился и говорил мне заткнуться тогда раз мне не нравится как он меня поддерживает, после таких пару раз я и вправду перестала говорить о своих проблемах так же приняла решение расстаться. и вот когда стало уже совсем невыносимо дядя положил бабушку в больницу где ухаживают за такими, я наконец-то смогла поспать, вымыла всё до блеска. тут приехал парень с цветами, конфетами и всякой ерундой, я решила дать ему шанс только из-за того что он как-то постарался для этого. через пару дней бабушка умерла, я была настолько разбита что помню смутно те дни, похороны, я ссорюсь с дядей из-за того что не хочу быть в одном доме с трупом родного человека, угрожал что убьет как увидит меня и всё в этом роде, на самих же похоронах я ревела навзрыд, это было ужасно. вечером же пришел мой парень, мы помянули и легли спать. в ту же ночь он начал приставать ко мне в том смысле в котором вы подумали, мне стало до тошноты противно от него, от всех его действий. в то время я очень похудела, можно было изучать биологию прямо по моему телу, он говорил что ему не нравится моё тело и он меня не хочет. в то же время я общалась с парнем сестры, (внучка дяди) сёстрами мы друг друга для удобства называем поскольку мы одного возраста. он был мне по душе, как-то уж сильно мы понимали друг друга, но сестра назовем её Маша очень ревновала его ко мне, на что я ей много раз говорила «давай я прекращу с ним общение» но она устраивала истерики потому что я была единственным его другом и Маша не хотела чтобы он меня лишился по её вине. со временем я начала понимать что влюбляюсь в парня Маши, оставила это в секрете от всех и рассталась со своим. на следующий же день после похорон слегла моя мать, она тоже стала лежачей и мне тоже приходилось ухаживать за ней, иногда даже подтирать ей зад, как бы противно это не звучало. ещё не успев отойти от смерти бабушки и всего что было мне приходилось готовить маме есть, но готовить ей нужно было по определённой диете из-за болезни желудка. поэтому готовила я почти что только ей, на себя сил не хватало. мне приходилось держать быт, ездить за продуктами и успевать учиться, к слову о учёбе, я забросила её в шестом классе, а в тот год меня чуть не отчислили потому что я не заходила ни на одну пару. маму то ложили в больницу, то выписывали и так продолжалось несколько месяцев. пока она лежала в больнице мне приходилось жить у дяди с тетей, и каждый день ездить к себе домой, тетя же недолюбливала меня и всю нашу семью, но почему-то видно это было только мне. Маша с назовем её парня Даня, ссорились каждый день и бывало по нескольку раз, она приходила ко мне за советами когда у меня и моих проблем было достаточно, но тем не менее я хотя бы отвлекалась так. в один день тетя сказала Маше что думает что Даня изменяет ей со мной, у меня хоть и была симпатия, но я не посмела бы так поступить. а Маша была из тех кто все свои секреты и личные дела рассказывает своим родным иногда выдавая мои и секреты Дианы из-за чего мы могли повздорить. Маша поверила тете и налетела с этим всем на меня, но мне было нечего скрывать, но всё же в конечном итоге они расстались, Даня признался мне и мне было нечего терять я тоже рассказала всё, позже мы начали встречаться, хоть это было и плохо по отношению к Маше, но почему я должна отказывать себе если им вместе не быть точно? Маша должна была понять меня, но этого не случилось, вся семья настроилась против меня, дядя который должен был взять опеку надо мной после бабушки отказался от этого назвав меня шлюхой, почему-то все уверены что я встречалась с ним за спиной Маши, может со стороны и выглядит всё это странно и быстро, но хотя бы сама Маша должна понимать что это не так, она ведь видела всё происходящее, но все факты она отрицает. из-за этой ситуации меня чуть не отправили в дет дом, оставили только для того чтобы я ухаживала за матерью, что я делаю и по сей день. мне страшно за моё будущее поскольку я даже не учусь, мне больно от всего пережитого и того что я переживаю сейчас, я не хочу больше ничего чувствовать, не хочу больше ничего видеть. я безумно устала, хочу свободно гулять и беззаботно жить как и все в моём возрасте, но к сожалению у меня нету такой возможности. если вы прочитали всё это до конца, оставьте пожалуйста хоть какой-то совет. в любом случае спасибо за то что читали и прожили вместе со мной немного моих воспоминаний.

Я знаю, что такое глубокое отчаяние, хотя и иначе, чем ты.

Я не знаю, какие варианты доступны там, где ты живёшь... Но я бы посоветовал тебе продумать план лучшего будущего, пока твоя мать не умрёт. Для начала, какой-нибудь способ жить безопасно и зарабатывать. Когда она умрёт, тебе следует реализовать этот план.

Возможно, тебе придётся уехать одной или обратиться к кому-то из знакомых. Не знаю. Но подумай хорошенько и, пожалуйста, будь осторожна. У тебя есть шанс на лучшую жизнь. Я верю, что ты заслуживаешь лучшей жизни. Но только ты можешь её осуществить. И ты должна быть очень осторожна, чтобы не попасть в ещё большие неприятности.

Если тебе когда-нибудь понадобится срочная помощь, напиши мне. Не знаю, смогу ли я помочь, но постараюсь.

От всего сердца желаю тебе много сил. || Я все прочитал. Сил тебе. Я вижу, что ты очень умная и рассудительная для своего возраста. Ты очень молода и все у тебя еще впереди, да, детство, мягко скажем, не задалось и я очень тебе сочувствую. Но у тебя все еще впереди, и все может образоваться. Учиться - никогда не поздно, и ты всегда сможешь доучиться и получить хорошее образование как только появится время и силы, всегда знай это. Я думаю, до этого не дойдет, но можно хоть и в 20, 30 и в 40 лет поступить в институт, так поступают довольно много людей, поэтому не переживай по поводу учебы. Не бойся и не переживай за свое будущее. Для образования у тебя ВСЕГДА будет время.

И смотри, не так все плохо, у тебя есть молодой человек и друзья, но будь к ним очень внимательна и не старайся не давать себя в обиду, ты в очень шатком положении, поэтому будь внимательна, следуй интуиции и постарайся слушать, что говорит тебе сердце. Это очень важно.

Может, когда у тебя будет больше свободного времени и сил, тебе стоит подыскать себе профессиональную психологическую помощь - в этом нет ничего страшного, просто записываешься на прием и вот рассказываешь ему, или ей, что тебя тревожит, как ты рассказала здесь, там человек опытный и сможет тебе помочь! А если не понравится этот психолог, всегда можно попробовать другого! Никто насильно таблетками лечить (если ты этого боишься) или в больницу тебя класть не будут. Только все равно будь аккуратна о том, что говоришь.

Всего тебе хорошего. || Ти так багато пережила. Сподіваюся, що з часом у тебе все владнається, і ти знайдеш мир і щастя. || Я знаю, что это может прозвучать банально, но пожалуйста, не отчаивайся.

У меня есть тебе совет, и я надеюсь у тебя найдется сил ему последовать.

В мире много добрых людей - и добрые люди любят помогать другим. Попробуй обратиться в организации, которые занимаются помощью людям, они для того и созданы. Сейчас много людей, которые готовы помогать украинцам, и много организаций. Они могут помочь тебе найти сиделку для матери, чтобы тебе не тянуть все на себе, помочь с продуктами и в целом с твоими нуждами.
Ты осталась одна в тяжелой ситуации, но из нее можно выбраться. Напиши в разные организации, кратко опиши свою ситуацию, тебе помогут или направят к тем, кто может помочь. 

Ты имеешь право на счастье, свободно гулять и беззаботно жить. 

Я надеюсь, у тебя всё получится :) || Я дочитал. Слушай, мне очень жаль тебя… я даже не знаю что сказать.

"How to distinguish depression, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD?","How to distinguish depression, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD?

My psychiatrist is treating me for generalized anxiety (pregabalin) with medication after I told him I have generalized anxiety disorder. This is based on a book on the subject and his YouTube videos. My wife says I have ADHD (also based on a book she's currently reading :-)). This is a very fashionable diagnosis among psychiatrists and psychologists these days. I feel like I have depression – I took the Beck test and got a score of 27, ""Your symptoms suggest you have severe depression."" One thing is certain: I don't have suicidal thoughts, but nothing brings me joy, I have no motivation, and I'm depressed, my sleep is a mess. Is there a way, a test, to distinguish between these conditions?

"Lowk might kms, might not, no one will care anyways lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 cant wait to find out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣","Yeah, I would commit but knives are too painful lol, I tried to slit my wrists and only saw my blood but I wasnt bleeding, 🤣 I guess I'm so bad at everything I do I cant even kill myself right, guns are too expensive, and so are drugs, so I keep getting yelled at by people for walking in the middle of the road when cars are coming when I go out. I don't purposefully waste the car and walk into the road, I just walk on autopilot and cross the road without realizing, anyways, if I were to die instantly from a car crash I wouldn't be mad, I've been getting really mad lately to the point where I almost had a heart attack, and I was lowk happy thinking I was gonna die soon, but I clearly didn't. So the point is, I wanna die, but I'm not gonna kms, but I want something to kill me. Also, I hate myself because I feel like I have no right to be depressed. I live in a place in Lower Income central Florida in the US every house where I live is under 130k and 1 story, small yard, ugly trees, no community, sad, depressing, 1 bathroom, very small home. But thats the most of it, I have a park not to far from my house, but I have no friends so it doesn't matter. I have alot of stuff I guess, I have a ps4, an Xbox, a Nintendo switch, a PC, 2 monitors, a nice keyboard, a big TV, a bunk bed, everything a boy could want, so I should be happy. Right? Well, sadly no. I used to live in a really rich area, like house were 200k or more, still 1 story bc I'm not a millionaire, but it was a medium sized 2 bathroom house with a garage, with was so cool to me, U had everything when I lived there, friends, family to hang around, I enjoyed playing games and actually enjoying my life lowk. Then I moved, I lost all my happiness, I deadass cant get happy from anything, I love music but it all just makes me sad, any type of music makes me sad, I cant play my favorite games anymore bc they make me nostalgic and sad, I don't smile when doing anything, anymore and I don't feel like life will get any better, I fucking hate when happy idiots try to come up to me and tell me some bullshit like life gets better, it fucking doesn't so go fuck yourself, I hate when people who live in 2 story houses with more than 3 rooms try to tell me something like they understand, they fucking don't, im miserable, I hate my fucking life.

Tried to confide in a family member but got insulted instead,My aunt is a psychiatrist so in the past I have tried to talk to her about certain issues. Tonight I tried calling her because I was feeling suicidal and depressed and just wanted someone to talk to.  I’ve honestly been in a very dark place and desperate. Instead of comforting me she went on a rant how I’m manipulative and treated her very badly because I never take her advice. She said think about how it makes ME feel when you don’t take my advice it makes me feel useless. I honestly think she’s the manipulative one for saying that.  Just because I’m not cured doesn’t mean I’m not following your advice like wtf. It made me feel 1000x worse and more of a reason to isolate. I can’t believe she would talk to me that way when I’m clearly suffering. It was honestly such a shock that I was struggling to find the words. She wants me to call her back tomorrow to tell her I’ve followed the advice she’s given and I said no im not. I just needed a kind ear and instead I got yelled at. No wonder I want to die. Sorry I’m just so in shock right now ,"I feel that. My brother did some shit like this one time. Started crying for no reason in the car and he got mad at me, “why are you crying!?” Then he got mad at me and pushed me into a full mental breakdown. He felt bad and tried to comfort me a little but he just doesn’t understand. Made me feel so alone I thought about killing myself. It sucks when you think in the back of your mind you can depend on someone and then when you put it to the test you realize each of us really is all alone in this fucking universe. Left to die. || Literally. She said do you think you’re smarter than a psychologist?? Like just because I’ve been too depressed to get psychological testing doesn’t mean I think I’m smarter than someone else? Also not sure how getting psychological testing will magically cure me. She takes one thing and runs so far with it. It was kind of shocking to witness in real time. I couldn’t even get a word in so I just gave up and accepted I can’t confide in this person anymore. || Yeah that sucks sorry you went through that",1753761780.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc1lt9/tried_to_confide_in_a_family_member_but_got/,depression
I don’t know how to keep going. I just needed to say this somewhere.,"**Please stop scrolling for a moment.**

I’m not an influencer. I’m just a guy who lost almost everything -  
his home, his family, and his hope.

I’ve been working on an album for months (– no, this is no self promotion, this is a confession)  
not in a studio, but in an abandoned factory I live in.  
I’ve gone through a divorce, I barely see my son,  
I drive taxi at night and restore old car interiors during the day to survive.

**This month everything collapsed.**

A Bolt driver crashed into my car and insurance company took me just as a bad joke.  
Then a long taxi ride never got paid.  
Then I tore my tire which I replaced,  
but now I don’t even have money for fuel to continue my night drives.  
No joke – I’m days away from losing my last chance to survive.

But I didn’t want to go down quietly.

Yesterday, after a complete breakdown reached me,  
I recorded a raw **unplugged demo** of my last song...

No studio. No team. Just me,  
a mic, a DAW, a drum set made of a table,  
toilet paper stand holding a knife, spoon, ashtray –  
and every last bit of pain I had left.

This song is the only thing I have left.  
It might even be the last I ever release.

I put **all my pain** into it. I believed I can share it here... but only thing I found, I can't do it a way I need it. A way I have a time for... A way, that can save me...   
All the time I believed in words, that... well... Because sometimes one song can hold a whole human soul.

But this doesn't matter as well... I never used Reddit before, but hoped it will be the place where I can share my thoughts through my music... Or my words... F\*\*k... It's full of rules, you can't even move a wrong way without being deleted... I created this profile for starting my project 2 months in advance from now on, but well, I don't have any time left... I finished whole my album, but now I already know, that I won't have a chance to release it... It's just a matter of time (hours? maybe days?) till everything collapse completely under my hands. I don't have any other solution to this situation, only waiting even while I am still trying to survive, to work, to go on... But this system, this system is not forgetting... You fall down, so is there any help? Well, yeah... a hard kick right into your face and no more chance to get up, even when you need just a little time, a few days to catch up... few fc...in days more to catch up... no, money won't forget a bit, money is everything in this world... money means more than life... Just one week to catch the time up and I can hold everything together, but no way... I don't have this week... I am done... Don't know what to do anymore... I lived my life to find out it's ending up in my 40's... It's still too soon to fell down with no way back to normal life. I held myself for years, I was quite happy even when I lived here in this godforsaken place... but just few unlucky days in a row to find out your life ends here, at this point... I lost the fight already... One day? Two days? Maybe 3 days for mobile operator cuts me off from the world completely. Than even here, in this abandoned factory I pay rent... Yeah, another few days to loose this place... Debts rising faster than I can make money. System is set up that way... Falling down with no chance to get back... Great. I don't want to live this way anymore. I can't simply catch up that system. I CAN'T ANYMORE... If I disappear from here in the next days, it won’t be because I didn’t care, but because this world didn’t care enough to give me one more shot.

It is my confession...

  
If anyone is interested in this song, you can find it in my profile... As my first and also last shout to the world we live in... 

If anyone knows of any solution to the situation like this, please let me know. But I don't know any existing one...

Is this really all it is?,"Life is so tiring. All it is work, go home, sleep, work, go home, sleep. Barely ever get time to actually do anything, and if i do, i can’t because im too exhausted. I even forget to eat sometimes because im so tired. I cant take less hours of work because i need the money for bills. The world just feels so messed up.
Like i know it could be worse but this feels like absolute hell sometimes. 
Are we really only here to just work?","Seems like it. People will tell you that you can work to start your own business, find a job where you're your own boss, or that having vacation days will ease that burnout.

What today's standards of what ""work"" is, I do not believe we were meant for this. 

Work is supposed to have value and purpose, a sense of accomplishment. Long long ago, they'd fight animals for meat, pick fruits from bushes, garden, grow stuff, etc. that was work. That was achievement. That's purpose.

Working an office job or some 9-5 job, you never see the end result of your work. There's no sense of achievement at all.
Sure, getting a paycheck and paying bills can give a sense of achievement but depending on how you look at it, but I do not believe this is what we were meant to do. || Yeah society fucking sucks, humans were not evolved to work 9-5s until they die. The system needs to change. I'm gonna try and leave where its worst, and go to places with better vacation laws. || Thats a really good idea.

I hate this so much.,"I don't know if this is anything serious, but I always feel like everyone is talking about me or is judging me. I feel like their a camera in my light with no lightbulb, I keep convincing myself it's there and I covered my posters and family pictures with sticky notes on my wall because I felt like they were judging me. I also feel so weird with my long mirror on my closet door and I'm convinced someone is watching me through it even though no ones there. I act like i'm talking to a human in my mirror and that someone is watching and judging my every move on the other side, I avoid watching or writing things in front of my mirror and I always want to cover it because I always get a feeling someone is watching me in the comfort of my own room. Everything that has eyes in my room I feel judges me, I'm also convinced that my stuffed animals have cameras in their eyes and someone is posting the footage and that's why people give me weird looks in public or watch me. Whenever my parents and family members  are speaking in  creole which I don't understand I always feel like their talking about me or being rude in front of my face. Sometimes I know their talking about me too. I wish I didn't feel like this and this isn't the first time I felt everyone didn't like me too, during the school year I was actually thinking of suicide and I might have been depressed, but I don't want to say that because if I wasn't I might come off as rude and ""Self Diagnosing"" and I feel bad for thinking I was. I just feel like theirs so much going on and I don't want to be sad ever again after everything that happened with my feelings during the school year and I'm scared to feel like that again. It just feels like it's easier to feel judged and sad then happy and positive. ",I don’t know anything about anything but this sounds like OCD or something?

Why am I so depressed when everything is fine?,"Sorry, this is kinda long…

Hi! I’m 15F, and I don’t understand anything. I understand I’m a kid/teen, and I’m just super young. I’m immature, but I’m positive I have depression. I was never diagnosed because of my parents beliefs. My dad thinks that depression is a phase and what I’m feeling will go away. But it doesn’t. It’s been stuck with me since 5th grade.

I feel so guilty because people have it way worse than me, and my ass is complaining, hurting myself, and fantasizing about my own death. I live fine. I’m middle class, and I live comfortably. I have parents who immigrated to the states to give me a better life. They give me what I want and need, and I appreciate them with all my heart. I have friends, I don’t get bullied much, and I have a wonderful boyfriend. So why do I feel so lonely? I'm depressed all day, and all I think about is dying or hurting myself. I can’t get out of bed; I don’t have motivation to do anything. I can’t even take care of my hygiene. I just want to die, but I hate pain. My life seems so good, but I look like an ungrateful brat. 

I told my parents about hurting myself and depression, and all I got was “think positive,” “we don’t believe in therapy,” “you have nothing to be depressed about,” “are you hurting yourself for attention?” and more. It hurts so much hearing that from family. I have no motivation to live, but the only thing keeping me alive is pain because I don’t have the balls to take my own life. I’m scared. I have no plans for the future, and I know I’m young, but time passes. I’ll end up on the streets or living in my parents basement being a nobody. I want to get better. But feeling this way is so comforting. I don’t know what to do. Why do I feel this way? ","You are not ungrateful, your pain is real. Depression can happen even if life looks good. You deserve support, even if your parents don’t understand. You are not alone, and things can get better. || Don’t take your life, depression doesn’t last forever. Try joining a club or sport or a part time job once your old enough || Take a hot shower or listen to music when you feel like want to hurt yourself || These same thoughts go through my head. I'm 14f. The description of your life is very similar to mine. And I hate myself for thinking this too, because there are others worse off than me. And, I'm sorry if this isn't the answer you're looking for, but this way of thinking doesn't leave. Unless you drink a magical potion, anything I tell myself will eventually be overridden by the ""I shouldn't be like this"" voice in my head. 


But who knows, maybe life will change. There is still a road ahead of me, however long or short. I'm sorry that this isn't what you're looking for. I wouldn't post this comment because of that, but i guess I just want to let you know that you're not alone.  || Do you have a school counselor you can talk to? || Bro my parents let me take 1 short hot shower a day, but for me I still stay for like 30 mins || I don’t trust counselors anymore because every time I’ve tried, my parents have been called, and it ends in me being grounded. || Frr, I was in 3rd grade 1 time talking about how I hated myself and my fuckass counselor texted my parents telling them how much she liked me, like why the fuck would she do that, at the time I lowk would've slapped ts outta her if I wasnt in 3rd grade 😔",1753750570.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbxsip/why_am_i_so_depressed_when_everything_is_fine/,depression

I tried suicide but I failed.,"I'm 19 years old and let's start from the very start of my life when I was born. My mother gave birth to a premature baby 1 month premature I was supposed to be born on October but september is my birthday month. This shit caused something in my lungs I was on baby ventilator for 6 months. Before I was born my family was very rich like the richest of the city but my father and his older brother had some issues and he snitched and income tax raid was there in my house so everything was gone. My father would legit walk 7-8 kms weekly just to get me injections when I was 1 year old. We were 3 brothers. Let's say for example. Special brother, older brother and me. My special brother was mentally challenged he was born right but due to some fever he got some mental illness. I'm the youngest brother special brother was older than me like 5 years and older brother was the oldest he was 8 years older than me. After my special brother became a disabled child my mother opened a NGO daycare centre for all special needs child just because she knew what pain the parents feel to take care of the child and she would do it for free. 2012 the special brother passed away... I uh I don't know what to say about it but I cried a lot. As I said I had lung issues so In my childhood i was not able to play any sports I used to like basketball but if I dare to play it. My lungs would just take me to bed for another month making me a living dead body. Finally when I was healing and became healthy in 2017 my father used to earn well we even made 2 houses and all suddenly he got a brain stroke and everything stopped. I used to live in the centre of a city and doctors told my father that he needs to go somewhere quiet. When you're just entering your teenage years and this happens your whole life changes. I was so shocked. I cried a lot. I screamed. We shifted out of city into a town of Hilly area. My brother was just 19 when my father had the stroke so he took responsibility of the business. My mother was also struggling to keep the ngo running because there was no money to invest. And donations were not enough. Then slowly my brother became very angry and my new father. He used to beat me. He legit choked me once till I gave up on living. My dad was the same he used to beat us when we were children aswell. Well lockdown time comes around corona. My father owned several warehouses of wine and alcohol and my brother used to manage it. He started drinking. He was very brave. He was very strong. His confident would legit shake anyone standing in front of him he made several contracts with the army and started a construction company and used to take contracts with army itself. I was in another small school. The school was owned by a friend of my mother's. In that school i started learning music. Annual function came I did my performance and it was so lit everyone started clapping and shouting my name. Every single parent there clapped but my father was not there 🥺 I was so sad I cried on spot and told everyone I'm just too happy but my mother knew it. Everytime in morning I would see father's dropping their son's off the school and loving them and here I am that one cursed child. My mother developed a heart disease in which her heart valve is leaking. My father called me and shouted that's what you wanted motherfucker your mom's gonna die. I cried that day aswell everyone in my house was fighting and I was the youngest so I was the first to be beaten. I tried killing myself 2018 but I could not when I tried to hang myself i accidentally chewed my tongue due to immense pressure on my throat and immediately did a pull-up on the fan and removed the cloth. Lockdown passed by my brother got married and his wife knew nothing about home. How to iron and all everything I taught her because she asked for. One random day my father tells me that go around the block and show her everything like near house. I grabbed the umbrella because I had a feeling it was about to rain and it did but his wife was there without umbrella and to i offered her that you can have it I will quickly run back home she said no let's just keep going. In one umbrella I was like okay if u want then she held me hand and that shit was so bad I told her I'm not like this. Straight of she laughed it off like I'm a joke then one day she was ironing clothes ( everyone in my house irons their clothes themselves ) I told her to  set the temp lower as it was a thinner shirt of my brothers she told me how to I showed her nd she kissed me dude. I told her again that please stay in your limits your my brothers wife and she looked at me this time and told me to leave strictly. I tried to tell my brother but I was scared that he will think it's me because it's always a man's fault. After some weeks she was gone to her hometown for some work and from there she told my brother that your younger brother tired to grab me and pushed me on to bed and tried to kiss me. My brother said that to my parents in front of me when I was eating the food..I was so shocked and I told everything he hit me and said don't fool me you're always like this and he kept hitting me I was unable to walk. That day I told him you trusted that lady of few weeks over a brother of 17 years. Don't talk to me ever again. And we never talked straight forward ever again. My brother had a babygirl on October 2nd and he was so happy. He died at a young age of 26 on 29th March 2023. 😔 After that I came to know about the truth in his voice recordings there are numerous arguments of him and his wife and one of them is about me that my brother would never touch you so she cried and my brother said alright I'll make him away from u. I can't live both of my brother's died my father is paralyzed my mother has heart issues I wanna commit suicide. I wanna die asap my birthday is on 17th September and I have made up my mind that I'll kill myself on that day cause I genuinely can't take it anymore:( I used to hate my brother but he was trying to save me all along and 🥺 even when he died I could not do anything to save him. When he died my mother shouted at my face that it should have been you and not him. I'm so broken. I can't anymore. Please god if you're listening I have seen enough now please.

I need advice,"I’ve been wanting to kill/hurt myself for the longest time ever. I would usually get over it and distract myself with something else, but nothing seems to get my mind out of these thoughts now. The urge to hurt myself is getting out of hand, the idea of ending my life is consuming me every single day and I don’t know what to do. 

If someone sees this, can you PLEASE give me some advice on how to deal with this? It’s making my life even more insufferable and I really need it to stop. ","i was the same, then started doing it, then feeling like shit for doing it, then it became addicted... once you start it's hard to stop.. maybe i should warn you that..

therapy and medication is the only thing that helped me and at some point i just started thinking it was cringey and unnecessary. but at the moment it seemed like the only option. i also took clonazepam from stoping the urges..

this isn't a very positive comment as you can see, but just so you know, we know the desperation you feel, and i hope you can take some deep breaths and maybe just cry your heart out. most of the times it helped. you need to redirectionate (is that even a word) that anxiety. grab a plushie or something that makes you feel comfortable, cry..

my psychiatrist told me once to always have cream on my bag so i can distract myself with something pleasant. nice smells, soft or mushy stuff.. they comfort

Venting. I fucking hate being sober things have just been worse,I have been sober for about 5-6 years and I fucking hate it. I feel like things have just gotten worse since being sober. Life has never just been okay and doing anything is just a battle. And if I need to take antidepressants to be numb why not just do drugs at this point. I had a pretty rough childhood and have an incredible hard time connecting with and generally trusting people so I have absolutely no support system. Even when I try I feel like an outsider. My job is having layoffs so I don’t feel comfortable investing in any form of hobby. And honestly at this point I feel so burned out and lost I have no idea what to do to dig myself out of this hole. ,"Well I’m not sober and physically dependent currently and I can tell you I don’t feel any happiness or joy from the drug use.

but... it's all superficial.

in my dating life, all my relationships fail.

when they stick around long enough to witness the real me, they think twice...

I've been diagnosed with both ptsd and pdd (persistent depressive disorder) – a pretty shitty combo. 

it gets hard to manage.

and they don't understand it because they haven't been through what I've been through.

Can't even talk to people in VR Chat 😂😂😂. I'm such a fucking brain dead loser.,"It's so fucking clear talking to people helps, so why don't I do it? Oh my god I'm so dumb for believing life had any other purpose. God I'm so dumb. It's all about having friends, it's like duh... But I actually started believing that my hobbies or self love would matter. But no, right when I'm starting to build confidence I get this sudden panic attack and feeling like all efforts are for nothing and I should've put more energy into talking to people my age. Oh well too bad it's what I want secretly to suffer so I feel different from others. I'm such a weird fucking creature actually. I'm actually a lunatic the way I behave and avoid having a social life at all costs. I need to kill myself fast unless I find friends, which I can't even STILL do in VRchat. Hahaha crazy. I guess people(me) never change ❤️😂

Like people don't even take me seriously anymore. When I'm crying and depressed it's just like ""get your sorry as away from me"". And I agree. I'm borderline retarded because I don't learn that socializing is the only thing that matters. -have a good day: spend it with friends. Have a bad day: you get to distract yourself with friends. Do anything: better with friends.

But yeah no I keep ""forgetting"" that life isn't about me, it's about fitting in. Fuck my dumb ass nerdy retarded ugly cringe fuck face that thinks he is above others. I secretly think I'm gonna be like cooler than everyone just cause I choose to be lonely. But then I end up here whining about being lonely you know what I deserve this shit. Don't wanna socialize? Then suffer alone. I serve no purpose except making people uncomfortable or sad. This shit is ridiculous. And I believed my family and therapist that I should believe in myself but u know what? No I fucking don't and I will never do until I feel included somewhere. Being alone is stranger bizarre and puts anyone at risk of mental issues. Fuck everything else except socializing. Workout? Try 3 x reps of talking to women instead and see how tough you are fucking faggot. To think I think I'm gay sometimes just shows how fucking strange I've become. I never get an answer, I never feel ok. I will when I'm included in a social circle that fits my view of ""cool"". And I'm tired of pretending anything else matters in terms of mental health. Because I've been trying.. why isn't it enough..","I don't think anyone can socialize with the people who spend their lives in VR Chat.   Lol


But seriously,  socialization can be important for mental health,  but depending on the type of who you are socializing with,  it can do more harm than good.   I once had a very large friend circle and it was toxic.  Once I realized how bad it was,  getting out of it saved some of my mental health.   Socializing isn't everything. 


Living and being ok on your own is just as if not more important.

About meds, the ones I tried made me really numb. They do make you feel like a zombie || You honestly echo many of the same things that go around my head whenever I think about these things. I have this ""old self"" that I am trying to get back to, but some things from that prior life will never be the same again, even if I try.

You mention a ""lack of motivation"".

It's just too much to deal with my own existence atp. But it's like I'm just tolerating myself like a parent tolerates their kid because they cannot abandon them. || I echo your sentiment, I wasn’t always like this, but I’ve been stuck for over a year now || Honestly, this level of depression is new to me. Some days it feels like I've just had a long string of bad days and I'll wake up one morning with a good attitude, healthy mindset, and it'll all blow past. It never does. If anything, it gets worse. || It gets worse and worse unless you manage to break out of it.
In my case its chronic depression so I have bad phases for weeks, months or years until I manage to break out and then its kinda in the background until it strikes again.


Any ideas as to whats making you depressed? 
At this point its fueling itself but I mean what started it all.  || Honestly speaking, downing the bottle of meds feels more tempting by the day.

No idea. Lack of motivation? But that's a symptom, not a cause. Living in a household where if they found out I'm in the closet, I'd be thrown to the curb? Perhaps that, honestly... || ""Living in a household where if they found out I'm in the closet, I'd be thrown to the curb? Perhaps that, honestly...""

My depression made my life look pointless and I can't stop fearing this despite improving so much.,"Hello, I'll try to be as precise as possible. And before starting this: I apologize for any grammar mistake as english is not my main language or if I talk about my life a bit too much and sound like a jerk.

Last year I went through what I think that was the worst year of my life. The point is, because I was falling in a spiral of decay and depression I had to face the ""typical"" depression symptons:

Lack of motivation, anxiety, feeling that I'm worthless, that there's no point in doing anything... and a million more things that I'm sure you guys have been through. Like I mentioned, this happened last year and after realizing that the only solution to fixing myself was, well, myself, I was able to get out of that depression, to the point where I could think about those fears without going back into a state depression. (And I apologize if my way of wording it sounds like it was easy to fix it and offends anyone who's going through it, it's not my intention). So this year everything went very well, I won't say a lot but I got scouted for a big football club's youth team and I couldn't be happier but, then there's this one feeling that I still couldn't beat.   
  
The fear of knowing that I'll die sooner or later and that everything will feel pointless.. I don't want to age, I don't want to be an adult and go into my 20s, then 30s, 50s... and then miss being young and have regrets. It all feels so, depressing, I could be in the happiest moment of my life then I'll be hit with the ""you know once this is over you'll miss it, and then you'll age, and then die."" I hate it, I need help to cope and get over this because I just really don't want this thought to ruin every moment in my life. Heck I'm still so damn young yet I already miss being even younger, so what when I'm older? What will it be of me? Why does it feel like nostalgia is a poison? And the worst of all is when I'm trying to learn something, or improve myself and, despite being so damn young, my mind goes like ""hey it's too late for that, you'll be a grandpa sooner or later so then what? What's the point of working out for example if at some point I'll look in the mirror and be a grandpa, then what? what's next?""

And it's terrifying. I feel so egoistical, knowing many would kill to be in my position yet it seems only I would be unfortunate enough to sabotage myself when I should be grateful... But I just can't stop thinking about that fear... I really need help to understand it and challenge that though, I need to beat it and make sure this doesn't fuck up my life again after trying so much... I need to accept that death comes sooner or later and that life itself is meaningless but I just can't, sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up one day, or sometimes I just wish I hadn't been born at all. I really can't let this thought make me suffer my entire life.

I apologize for getting so personal and if I sound like a jerk. My life looks so perfect in the eyes of everyone but for whatever fucking reason, it doesn't in mine, fuckass ""you'll be old and die one day so why would you do anything"" hurts so much. And it makes me want to die, seriously.

TL;DR: Depression made me think life is pointless because we all die and it's still making me feel so bad despite improving my life so much and I can't find a reason in doing anything at all but at the same time I don't want to have an average life without achievements.","Depression is like an inevitable curse that would come to your life unexpected at an uncertain time.

Yes, I did and do have suicidal/self-harm thought but I'll never do that. But what do I do? How to escape this phase? Therapy - yes but first I need to get a job. Is there a way to help myself?

"Trauma, homelessness, and now urgent psychiatric care. I need help.","After 3 months of trying to survive one thing after another, I’m now at a point where I need psychiatric hospital care. I’ve been self-harming and recently attempted again. I don’t have the means to pay the upfront fees for admission and evaluation. I need help..financial, emotional, anything to get into a hospital as soon as possible.

I’ll try to keep this short, but a lot has happened in a very short time, and it’s been overwhelming.

Three months ago, I made a post on Reddit (since deleted because of people harassing me or sending sexual messages..) during one of the lowest moments in my life. A kind stranger reached out to me privately to try and talk me down. I told them what I was going through..how my mom had taken out debts with loan sharks and put them in my name. I had less than a week to pay them off. On top of that, my mom and stepdad were kicking me out of the house. I was terrified, alone, and desperate.

After some back-and-forth and them making sure I wasn’t trying to scam anyone, they offered to help. They sent money so I could pay the debt and make a deposit for an apartment. I was able to get a place. I was very thankful. But it didn’t stop there..

The loan sharks didn’t leave me alone. They found out where I lived, harassed me constantly because they think I was going to report them to authorities outside of town. Even after that, they kept showing up, trying to break in. I was living in constant fear.

With that same kind stranger’s help, I escaped and took a bus and ferry across the country to get as far away as I could.

Eventually, I was able to stay with some roommates. But everything I had been through began to catch up with me. I wasn’t stable. I wasn’t safe from the world or from myself. My mental health was spiraling. My roommates tried to be there, but it got too much for them. They said they couldn’t live with me anymore. So I left.

I was homeless for a few days. Then, once again, the same person who had been helping me all this time gave me money to stay in a hotel. That’s where I am now.

But I’m not okay.

I attempted to end my life in the hotel just a few days ago. I don’t want to keep doing this. I don't want to keep relying on that person. It has been too much.. But I also I don’t want to die. I just need help. Real, professional, psychiatric help before something worse happens. I know I need to be admitted to a hospital. I want to go.

But the problem is, most hospitals here require upfront fees for admission, evaluation, and professional assessments even if insurance covers the rest afterward. The cost ranges between $500 to $1500 USD depending on the hospital. It’s money I just don’t have. The person who’s helped me so much has already given a lot and is doing everything they can. They and my former roommates have been calling hospitals nonstop, trying to get me in. But we’re stuck on this: the upfront cost.

So I’m here now, reaching out and asking if anyone can help. Whether it’s financially, emotionally, or even just helping spread the word. I know this all sounds unbelievable. I barely believe I’m still alive writing this. But this is real. This has been my life for the past three months. I’ve survived things I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

I’m keeping things vague here to protect myself and others involved, but if you want to help and need more details before doing so, I or the person helping me can share more privately (depending on what my roommates are okay with too).

Please. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you can help in any way..Thank you..",,1753743261.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbv2d9/trauma_homelessness_and_now_urgent_psychiatric/,depression
Every Relationship feels transactional,"People are just there until you serve them good and when it is over, they simply just vanish. 

People say that parental love is the most superior but the same parent doesn't even think twice to abandon their children when their dreams around their children are shattered or the parents and children goals and dreams don't align- or the worst, you remain dependent on them when unemployed.

Institution of marriage and love often feels like a business contract- it's easy to break someone's heart, cheat on someone, have sex with strangers behind their partner's back, leave their partner after having child. Relationships are often so fragile when you see their true nature when unemplyed and stuck in home for more than 2 months.","thats cause they are. the moment youre no longer of use, you are discarded. Unless guilt kicks in and they stay around out of pity. 

and let's not pretend everyone else is evil and we are better. We are all wired this way. Relationships are there to facilitate our survival as a species, it's literally a survival tool. We just turned it into this mushy romantic fantasy. But nature is cruel and unforgiving. Look at parental love in animals. They kill off weak children or leave them to die. Would you stay with a friend or partner that doesn't provide you with anything? No, at least they're supposed to make you feel good or something. In the end relationships are all about what you're getting out of them. If the answer is nothing, you leave.

In the end, everything revolves around nature and survival of the fittest. || Unfortunately, it's always been this way; everything is a coexistence based on transactions.
There are people who rob you emotionally and financially, then stop talking and go looking for someone else.
Many call it ""having goals, dreams, being successful,"" but they're just rats who take advantage of others to climb the ladder.
In this life, you don't have to give everything for someone, nor do you have to let them take advantage of your good intentions.",1753706152.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbezhj/every_relationship_feels_transactional/,depression

The worst part is that I am buddhist so I don't really think death helps any of this. In fact it could make it worse if reincarnation truly exists (I hope it doesn't and this is all just make-belief)...

None of it feels real," nobody feels really truly genuine half of the time and they just end up feeling like scripted dialogue without any real thought or emotion behind it


I've been thinking about if I'll even leave a note when I decide to do it and sometimes I find relief in imagining my own death and how others will probably cry and mourn over me at least that will probably be genuine


I have been pushing myself for a year or two maybe three, I can't tell when this all started but I have slowly lost all desire to be human or to be a person


I've been faking my interactions with my psychologist or therapist or whatever they are for most of the time they ask if I'm suicidal and I say just a little and they ask if I have any intentions or plans and I say not really but I have almost every intention just not a solid plan


it make me a little sad that my family will most likely live to see me dead even the older ones but what am I supposed to do?


Sometimes in school I imagine I have a gun in my mouth and imagine what would happen if I shot myself in front of everyone


I hate that my few ways of escaping will soon disappear or be blocked behind other things I will have to do and so all I have left is my mind as imagination where I slowly rot inside and can feel myself becoming apathetic and even resentful towards others


A long while ago about a year ago on two occasions I put my mom's gun in my mouth and almost pulled the trigger since then it has been locked away in a safe


I have a knife that no one knows about in my room just a few feet from my bed hidden I think about using it every day


I am so behind in school that I have slowly stopped caring and have told myself it won't matter later because I'll be dead


I'll be a senior in a two weeks and I feel nothing no sense of accomplishment or pride just tired and hateful towards my education

Starting again,"Do you ever just wish that you could start again, that you could lose your memory and become someone completely different? 

I feel so jealous of people with amnesia because they get to pick and choose what they remember, what they choose to keep. I know it doesn’t really work like that but the most craven irrational parts of me are still envious

I just want to forget all of the bad things. I’ve got a major trauma anniversary coming up and I’ve not really got anything going for me. Nothing seems worth it anyways. I’m medicated so I can take care of myself and pretend to be happy but nothing ever feels worth it. I feel like a robot, like a facade of a human being.

I used to be such a creative, happy, imaginative child, but that all ended one day. Now I’m just rotting while I’m still alive. I like feeling sad because at least it means I’m not numb, but maybe that’s the way to not exist- by not feeling anything at all.

Once this desire starts, it stays with me for so long. I’m either scared or angry these days, I don’t know which is worse. At least when I’m scared I don’t lash out at people around me. I just want to feel okay but I know that I’m doing everything I can. There’s no way out of this.

I’m just tired of caring so much. I’m just tired of everyone else being selfish and refusing to understand parts of me they find objectionable. I wish that I was dreaming and I’ll wake up as someone else.

I think the only way to live positively is to literally live for that second - everything you do doesn’t matter, live like that. || That’s true.

There are certain things going on in my life and in the world that make me feel like I’m buried underground in a coffin with no way out. It feels like just abandoning everything is the only way to fix these issues, even though I wouldn’t be me anymore

It’s not like I’m that great. People only like me because I’m pretending to be someone I’m not, and I’m either unhappy or I just don’t feel anything. || I had an issue with pretending too. Saying fuck it all and doing what I really want to do helped me breathe a little better.

I'm not great either. Most people don't really know the real me, even though I've stopped pretending. I still have trouble with it, but you can try to find the things you like about yourself. 

Examples taken from my second coming of teenagerhood (aka my 20s): ""I like my music taste and I'm gonna stop hiding it cause I think it's stupid."" Or ""I like wearing black and no one can stop me now, even if my mom hates it!""

I don't particularly want a long life.,"I'm not actively suicidal, and it's not like I *want* to die. I simply do not want to live to 70, 80, 90 - it just sounds very tiring, to be honest. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying there's anything wrong or bad with being old - I do hope my grandparents and parents get to have a nice long retirement - I'm saying I'm personally not particularly keen on the idea. I just want to be able to reach my goals, make a positive impact on those around me, and hopefully go out in a non-painful way. Will I regret not being able to see more of life? Maybe. But I'd rather have a well-lived life than a long life that I never lived at all. 

I'm not the type of person to follow the traditional trajectory of life. I don't expect to have much family or friends when I'm older; I have always been very introverted and more interested in losing myself in my interests than socializing. Some people would call it sad but it works for me, and the few close friends I have understand me well. I know a lot of people want to live a good long life, maybe with the person they love and their family - I don't, not really. Maybe it's because of my struggles with mental health, with family issues, maybe it's something intrinsic to who I am, but I just don't. At 13 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 18, at 18 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 25, and I don't see that changing. I've made my peace that I'll likely always struggle with my mental health; nowadays I just want to make the most of the time I do have on this earth.

I've never told anybody in my real life about this. I'm a fairly ambitious person, and I am a risk-taker, more often than not at my own detriment. I know the people who genuinely love me want me to play it safe, live a long and quiet life, but that's not me. I'm not going to be able to settle for that, not when it's way too close to how I've been living - being alive solely because you're not dead, and you have too many regrets to pass on. I pretend I understand where they're coming from but in reality I genuinely can not give up on my goals, and I can not worry them by straight up saying I don't want to stay here for very long.",,1753739360.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbthui/i_dont_particularly_want_a_long_life/,depression
Venting and need support,"First time posting here. I [29 F] have been struggling with depression since I was eleven years old. I’ve been living in survival mode since I was a baby. My father was not present in my life. My mother was so abusive to me. She taught me to ignore my intuition (even though I still feel it) and never taught me about boundaries. I was her emotional punching bag and therapist all throughout my childhood. This dynamic set me up to be abused as an adult, by people I’ve been in relationships with and my friends. I have never felt safe for long. I turned to drugs and alcohol for many years and it helped in the short term, but made things so much worse exponentially. I’ve been abstaining from alcohol for almost six months now. I am in a healthy relationship for the first time ever and it’s like my self-hatred is even louder. I can tell it’s bringing my partner down. I am in therapy weekly as much as I can, but my therapist is out of town for weeks at a time multiple times a year (at least three times in the past six months) which could be normal, I know therapists need a break, but I’m not sure the dynamic works for me. I feel like I just vent to her in our sessions. My depression always gets worse around my period, but in general, I am always sad and internalizing everything and punishing myself. I am finally seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow to try and get diagnosed and get on meds. My therapist believes I have OCD, depression, anxiety, and CPTSD. It hurts so bad. I’ve wanted to give up so much. I am embarrassed as well and feel so terrible for the weight I have put on my partner’s shoulders. They assure me they love me and want to see this through with me, but I feel so guilty and spiral because of the guilt. I am trying, but it is so hard.

I'm kinda not depressed. Just detached from my real emotions.,"No matter what medicine I take, it only changes how my usual feeling about life feels like. I still have this enormous hole or wound that feels like my soul is escaping out from. Sometimes usually when talking to people about it or becoming sucked in to the Convo I can get distracted for seconds at most.
But it feels so obvious that I'm detached from the strong emotions I have inside, that I guess are too painful or intense I'd rather be numb from them. It doesn't feel like depression, more like an energy that's being drained slowly when I'm not living the life I'm supposed to. It's quite scary that it feels like my chest everyday becomes more and more light(dissasioated from my heartbeat) because I can't stand how uncomfortable it feels to feel my heart barely pulsating. 

It really feels more like my confidence gets smaller and thereby my feelings for life. I have no will, no strength and no movement. It's just me, thinking about nothing and doing nothing. Can medicine really help me open up that wound inside me? It feels impossible. I'm only on an NDRI and antipsychotics so nothing really for anxiety or increasing serotonin. But I'm kinda done, I've tried Citalopram and short term anxiety medicine and it's just kinda changing how my confidence or happiness feels- not making it better or worse.

Lost marriage,"So it’s the day after our anniversary, which you’d think would be a happy time, but no… today was awful. All day, my wife has been playing the sad card, saying they’re unhappy and hate the day. I’m still getting blamed for all the problems in the relationship. I don’t get it. It’s like nothing can ever be their fault.

Here’s the kicker though: when I got home, they acted like everything was perfectly fine. Like they hadn’t spent the whole day tearing me down emotionally, and then they wonder why I’m upset. It’s like they become a completely different person, acting like they have zero idea why I’d be hurting.

I tried to make our anniversary meaningful. I didn’t expect much, since they kept saying, “don’t get me anything, I don’t want to celebrate.” But then they gave me a card. I had one too, I just wasn’t planning on giving it but decided to after I saw they got me a card. I didn’t want to be rude, but it’s still sitting there unopened. And while I don’t need them to read it, they’re clearly making a point to point out they haven’t opened it, like they just want to hurt me.

Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling depressed. I’m tired of having my emotions stomped on. It’s getting harder and harder to cope with this kind of treatment. I miss being happy. I miss enjoying life. I can’t feel those things anymore because I’m constantly walking on eggshells.

The hardest part of all this is our child. A divorce would be brutal, especially when it comes to custody. My partner acts like they’re entitled to full custody, such as they joke about it often, saying things like “when I leave you, our child will stay with me.” They say it like it’s funny, but it hurts. Because this kid is my whole world.

I’m the one getting them up every morning, taking them to school, picking them up, getting them ready for bed, showing up to every school event and activity. I’m the one who rearranges my work schedule if they get sick. I do all of that, and I don’t even complain because I love my child, but it’s just expected of me. And when I do have responsibilities at work and can’t drop everything, my partner loses it, giving me every reason they can’t do it instead and that I need to drop everything instead of them. 

It’s like my work isn’t seen as important or valued at all. They seem to think what I do is easy or meaningless. My therapist says this behavior is narcissistic, and honestly, I agree. I also think there are deeper mood issues going on.

I just want to be happy again. I put on a mask every day, pretending things are fine while emotionally I feel like I’ve been beaten up. I’m already on medication for anxiety, and while that helps a bit, the depression has gotten worse over the past year. I feel lost.

I don't feel happiness anymore,"I just can't feel happy, nothing ever makes me happy and everything just makes me wanna cry.

I finally got a sewing machine after wanting it so badly for some time now, my dad bought it for me and I don't feel happy about it, instead I just want to cry so hard until I fall asleep.

why can't I just be happy like everyone else?","I finally got a mustang gt after all these years. Didn’t fill the void in my heart. I thought it would change everything but I’m still miserable || i hear you. i’d wonder, can i actually not feel it or am i just not letting myself feel it? either way, i’ve stopped trying to feel happy. i’ve accepted it, and found comfort in that somewhat. i’m still unsure whether i’ve accepted it with defeat or revelation, but i’ll remind myself that i’m not alone.

gentle suggestion: don’t strive to be happy like everyone else. sit with whatever you’re feeling, and try your best to understand you. don’t feel pressured if you can’t exactly pinpoint why you are the way you are. just acknowledge. remember that you experience life in your own unique way, and you are not alone in ever feeling weird, broken, or hopeless. stop demanding happiness, and don’t beat yourself up (if you are) for not functioning like everyone else, or for not living up to your own expectations. to feel happy, seems so simple, yet so hard to actually experience for some of us.

perhaps you should ask yourself, why you are so desperate to just be happy. is it because you believe that’d make life easier? i say, just because you can’t seem to obtain this feeling, it doesn’t mean you’re missing out. maybe try redefining happiness for yourself. it doesn’t have to look like smiles and laughs. it can look like comfort, in doing anything you like. maybe your heart is yearning for something more, and you thought you could find that in this sewing machine, but you didn’t. or, maybe it is there, but you’re too distracted to see it? so to try and answer your question, you can’t be happy like everyone else, because you are not everyone else. it’s okay. the moment you accept this is okay, it gets a little less lonelier because you’ll know you have yourself. you’ll feel that. and debatably, i think that beats just being happy like everyone else. i apologize if i failed to miss the mark here, but i do hope things get better for you. if it means anything, i am in the same boat as you. you’re not alone 🤝 || same, I'm a huge fashion fan and I want to be a fashion designer so that's why I got a sewing machine as a gift.

 I thought it'd make me happy, that it'd change something. I think that the realization that nothing changed is what made me even sadder, to the point I don't even want it anymore || thanks for these words💛

I've honestly found too much comfort in my sadness, and I think that's the bad thing. I don't really try too hard to be happy, but sometimes I'm just so upset that all I can think about is how I wish I actually felt something.

I think that when I talk about the sewing machine, it's not about being happy per se, but being happy that I got something that I wish I had for a long time. I couldn't feel happy, I didn't even smile. all I did was thank my dad for the gift and, once he left the room, cry.

again thank you for everything you said, but I think I'm too far gone to be able to find comfort or happiness in anything. you're sweet and I appreciate that you took some time of your day to write this!!",1753716749.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbjdfc/i_dont_feel_happiness_anymore/,depression
I hate myself.,"Growing up I had a troubled childhood, my mom pushed my dad out of my life when I was 2, didn’t see him again until I was 18. My mom had a few different boyfriends, didn’t learn half of their names, then when I was 4 or 5 she was with a dude until I was 14. They adopted a baby, and I wish they never did tbh. He SA’d me from age 8 to 12. I tried to unalive myself multiple times until I was 16, was into drugs pretty heavily, until I got pregnant at 20. I got my shit together and was seeing somebody, moved in together, and broke up after 3 years. I moved into my mom’s house, as rent other places was insane, and I couldn’t afford anything as a now single mom.  The baby my mom adopted is now 18, he steals from me, and mom, my grandma and even my 7 year old.  He smokes weed CONSTANTLY in the house, where my 7 year old and elderly bedridden grandma live, and my mom doesn’t even ask him to stop. She lets him do absolutely anything he wants and he gets away with shit all the time because she simply doesn’t care. I hate even leaving my bedroom, being around my mom makes me anxious and I genuinely feel like I don’t even love her I just tolerate her, and it makes me hate myself, but o feel like she’s never been a mom, I feel like she never actually cared about any of us. I have 3 older brothers, too, they all left the second they could and I feel like they kind of feel the same on some level, they all love her because they have to because she’s their mom, but why don’t I feel that way? Am I broken? Because the fact she lets my brother do anything and everything just irritates me so much and it’s put so much strain on me. Recently he went into my grandmas wallet, took her debit card and went to the ATM and took $1100. And what did my mother do? Nothing. He denied it, then when he admitted it, she did nothing. Because he threatens to unalive himself. For fucking why? Because he’s gotten everything he fucken wants and needs, his life isn’t shitty by any means, my mom and her ex aren’t together but her ex is married and my brother visits him twice a month and gets whatever the he wants there too.. the last therapist I went to told me I have depression and anxiety and I need to practice my breathing.. like wtf even is that? I stopped seeing her cause that’s ridiculous. Also I feel like if I say too much, there’s gonna be cops involved and then I’ll be out on my ass with my kid and have no family at all, and idk.. am I broken? I just turned 29 and I feel like my whole life is a mess.. if I could afford to move, I’d be in a different country honestly.. anybody looking for a slightly damaged 29 year old with a 7 year old boy? 😂 if I don’t laugh I’ll cry.

I can’t go on feeling like this anymore. I won’t.,"It’s likely that nobody will read this. That’s OK. I just want to put this out there for my own sake. 

I really can’t do it anymore. Yeah - some pretty shitty things have happened to me lately. But that’s inconsequential. I’ve always had a bleak view on the world and am overly pessimistic. I’ve watched myself slip further and further into a dark place for years. 

Nothing interests me anymore except changing the way I feel with substances. I can’t remember the last time I felt a genuine moment of joy. I can’t take care of myself anymore. I don’t look forward to anything, and my days are consumed by simply fighting to keep my head above water and keeping up appearances in which I pretend everything is going fine. 

I just want to go back to laying in bed. I am just 28 and feel like I already died a long time ago.

This dark cloud above my head is relentless. I tried fighting it for a while, but now, I think it has won the battle.

I know deep down that my days are numbered. And sometimes, it gives me relief to know that soon, I won’t have to worry about that dark cloud anymore. I won’t have to worry about anything at all. ","I feel the exact same way you do. I’m 31. I’ve been dealing with this for 10+ years. No interests anymore, no motivation, no emotion. Just a void. I wouldn’t wish this suffering on anyone . I’m sorry you’re going through this. || Same here although I dont keep up appearances.
I dont care anymore.  || I understand you. It feels like we aren't living. People say it gets better, but I've been this way all my life. Does better mean we just keep coping until we die? || I’m a bit younger then you but I feel this. All of my interests and things that have kept me going and motivated are gone. I don’t know if you gotten to the point of actively killing your emotions when ever your around people. Let me just say, don’t. The feeling of depression is awful, but my head has become addicted to numbness, and I’ve been trying to get really emotion back for years now. Nothingness is so much worse then depression, because it feels impossible to reverse because you don’t have any thoughts left to reverse it. || I’m so sorry. You’re right, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. Trying to keep up with life and have the bills paid while feeling like this is truly hell on earth. || That’s what worries me too. I have always held on and hoped that the “you won’t feel this way forever” cliche would happen, but it hasn’t… what if it never does?

"I have depression, and my 4 month old son needs surgery.","Hello, Reddit. I see people use this place for all kinds of things so this is me trying to use it. I’m scared. Last year I had a mental health crisis, and I went to spend a week at a facility and it was the best thing that happened to me. I work in a hospital, and I see all kinds and deal with all kinds of stuff. But nothing could prepare me for when I was my own worst enemy and ended up planing my own death. It was a fleeting thought, I immediately told someone at the hospital and ended up in a PESS unit for 24 hours, then a behavioral health unit for a week. 

Diagnosed and treated for clinical depression. Apparently the care team thinks I’ve had it since I was about ten when my grandfather was killed in 9/11. But this isn’t about that. This is about how after everything, I’m feeling better. My wife gets pregnant, I’m on top of the world, and my son is born with Sagittal synostosis, also known as scaphocephaly, is a condition where the sagittal suture, a fibrous joint on top of the skull, fuses prematurely.

We took him to CHOP in Philadelphia, got him the best of the best and we did everything early enough where his surgery is scheduled for mid August. It’s not considered brain surgery, but a neurosurgeon is going to be present because of the nature of the surgery. But I shook the hand of the man who was going to put my baby boy to sleep, cut his skull open and place springs inside it. 

Of course I’m glad it’s happening. But I just got my world put back together. I’m scared, and with my depression I’m worried that I might let my own mental get in the way of the fact that he’s going to be ok. I can look at statistics, and do all the research all I want. We even met families who have perfectly healthy babies taking the exact same care team as us. 

But there is a voice in my head, warning me that I don’t know what I’m going to do if something happened to my son. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking apart from prayers and kind words for a father who is battling his own demons every day like I’m sure many of you are while also giving 100% of my concern and energy into my boy. He’s my whole world.

How to not to spiral?,"Im 23F and i’ve been on Zoloft for about 2 years now. I’m glad I’m on the medication as on a regular day, i can shower, sleep, cook and maybe even clean and its a good day but when I’m hit with some small event that makes me stressed, i find myself wanting to die. 

I don’t have a job despite trying and even giving my resumes to businesses that aren’t hiring. I tried DoorDashing and Uber and theyre not hiring in my area. My bills are overdue and my power is about to turned off tomorrow (thank you PG&E for the 48 hr notice ig). 

Objectively I have a good life, I don’t pay rent and just have to take care of the house I live in, and I only have to pay for amenities like power, water, etc. I have a working car. I’m doing fairly decent in school and even joined the student council at my college. 

I have so many things going for me and so many things I haven’t done yet in my life and yet just one stumble like bills or stress from being jobless makes me wanna die. 

It’s not even sadness that I feel, it just feels like… suicide is a *not good* solution for whatever problem i have, if that makes sense. It always feels like theres a gun on the table.

I guess my question is how to take the solution of suicide off the table? And deal with stress like a normal person ig? 

I dont have friends to talk to and I already worry my mom too much about my mental health so I don’t want to tell her. I went on a walk around my house to see if I’d feel better. I ended up enjoying the scenery but felt like it would be a good place to die. Of course that didnt make me feel better lol..

Am I depressed or just sad,"I’ve never posted on here (I rarely post on Reddit at all),  but I guess need to know what’s going on. I’m just really upset at the moment. It’s obviously summer and the entire time I’ve been feeling really hopeless. To give context, my mom’s an addict and she hasn’t lived at home for almost a year now. She’s been in and out of treatment for about three years, and even now that she’s better, I still feel like she can’t offer support. I’m going into my junior year in high school and as a highly ambitious student, I wish I had the same support and resources offered by my friends parents. Everyone’s off doing things and traveling and doing internships and being with other people but I’ve been stuck at home almost daily because dad works and mom isn’t here. All I’ve done this summer is practice my sport in the evenings. A few weeks ago I fell into my first truly depressive episode- I guess I just realized things would never get better at home. School and my sport and everything else that being an older teen brings are hard enough with support. I’m usually thrilled to start the new school year, but recently I feel like I have nothing to live for. I know people are usually like “it’ll get better don’t say that” yada yada but I genuinely believe that. Sometimes I cry for hours on end just because each day feels like a period to fill. Suicidal thoughts aren’t rare. I came to my mom the other day (a nurse) and said I needed to see someone. She accused me of “having an agenda” and drug seeking and said this is just teen feelings as a result of her stuff. I genuinely  feel like life has anything to offer anymore and it’s finally clicked that effort doesn’t necessarily mean things get better. I’ve given up on trying for something like an ivy.

Hopeless,"45m. I’ve been single for my entire adult life. I struggle with several mental and physical health challenges, including ADHD, depression, anxiety, sciatica, obesity, and a learning disability. These issues make daily life very difficult and have made it hard for me to build stability or move forward.

I live with my brother in Seattle, but I often feel like he sees me as a burden. I also hate where I live. The weather here makes me feel worse, and I don’t have the resources to move somewhere else or create the kind of environment I need to feel better.

Financially, I’m in a tough spot. I haven’t paid much into Social Security in nearly ten years, and I have no assets. I keep thinking about retirement and whether I’ll ever be able to afford it. Things are already so expensive, and it feels like the cost of living is only going to get worse. I don’t see a path where I’ll ever feel secure, and that uncertainty adds to the weight I carry every day.

I left my job to go back to school, hoping to make a fresh start, but now that I’m a year in, I worry I made a mistake. With how fast artificial intelligence is changing the job market, I’m afraid there won’t be work for someone like me by the time I graduate. It feels like everything is shifting, and I’m falling behind.

On top of all this, I feel incredibly alone. I’ve always wanted a significant other, someone to share life with, but it’s always felt out of reach. I want someone to talk to, someone who sees me and wants to be there. That kind of connection is something I’ve longed for, but I don’t know how to find it or whether I ever will.

All of this has left me feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. Lately, I’ve been asking myself what the point of any of this is and whether life is even worth continuing. I don’t know what kind of help I need, but I know I need support. I can’t keep doing this alone.",,1753726412.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbns92/hopeless/,depression

When I try to have conversations with others it just fizzles out due to my unconsciously awkward behavior, which I never have done before. I make mistakes that I used to never do, and I zone out constantly. I am always tired no matter how much sleep I get. I feel like a kid stuck in the body of an adult and I constantly have thoughts that rationally I understand are immature, but I can't help but shake. It's so pathetic.","yeah thats totally normal with depression. sorry youre also going through that || I feel this to, for me it’s the tire that gets the worst. I’ve gotten tired so easily and the only way I keep going when I’m around people is being emotionless which i don’t know if it helps, but I don’t want to try the alternative. || Since my recent panic attack, I don’t feel truly like myself either. I am having memory problems, cannot paint, or focus on any of my hobbies to keep distracted. Yes, I also feel this lack of energy like every hour is draining, I have tried supplements but not really working. || Perhaps you haven’t regressed at all. Perhaps, instead, you’ve just become so hyper aware of reality. || That's the weird thing. I feel like I'm overthinking things constantly, like I'm always in my head instead of conscious at the moment.

Tired and not in the mood for anything,"I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm missing out on my life and my potential. I got my first computer at the age of 10 and it quickly became a great passion. Over the years, I discovered programming, 2D/3D graphics, reverse engineering and so on. 4 years ago, I finished my studies and wanted to become a freelance web developer, but to do so I had to build up a portfolio. So I spent several months programming on personal projects. Unfortunately, at that point I started to develop an intolerance to gluten, but also to junk food in general, so the food I ate had a huge impact on my mood and fatigue. Living with my parents, with no income, I'm very dependent on them. I don't eat very well at home; for example, a meal might consist of two small packets of potato chips. About 2 years ago, I started to develop anhedonia. I don't feel any cravings anymore. Neither for computers, nor for all the other things I used to enjoy. I feel as if I don't know who I am anymore, as if part of my identity has vanished, it's a horrible feeling. Today I often feel depressed, the food I eat at my parents' makes me extremely tired, I have no energy, I wake up tired even though I sleep enough. I go out about once every three months and have no friends.

i’m so tired of being the only one who cares.,"diagnosed with bipolar 2 when i was 17. knew it was coming, my mom had it but refused to get diagnosed so we didn’t have a diagnosis for her to go off of but the behavior lined up. i’ve noticed recently that when im neutral or manic, things are always fine. people will actually interact with me, want to hang out, want to see me, etc. but the minute i go into a depressive episode, everyone just ignores me. they stop reaching out. they stop inviting me to do things. or they just completely dump me. i wish i could get it. i can’t control the way i am. i can heavily medicate it all i want, but other than that i cant do shit about it other than try to work on it. and that’s what i’m always trying to do. i miss the people ive lost because of it so much but i know im alone right now, and am gonna have to stick to it.",,1753719723.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbkq04/im_so_tired_of_being_the_only_one_who_cares/,depression
Probably A Reflection Of My Life Choices,"I could probably write a memoir of unfortunate events, twists I never saw coming, and coping methods that had less than desired outcomes. Not drugs or anything like that - but it suffices to say, the perhaps the road to hell truly is paved with good intentions, and probably accurately describes my attempts at a happy life. I have a lot, don’t get me wrong. I wonderful house, a well paying job, a beautiful child, and a loving husband who tries his best. 

At the end of the day I’ve slowly lost every connection outside of our little family and feel largely alone as each chapter has unfolded until there’s all but a few characters left in the story. I can’t help but think it is me, and I think I am just rather frankly unlikable, have gotten to a level of desperation for connection, and/or not in a position to give the attention a relationship requires to have one.

The quick and dirty: 
1. Drunk mom and a few steps from poverty - signed up for the navy to go to school and start life on the right foot. Left behind myself sister to suffer in that hell alone, and lost her later in years because of her sanity, to which I heavily blame myself for having left to save myself.
2. Met a wonderful man and knew what I loving family was like - followed through with enlistment to “change my stars” - lost it all, he couldn’t handle deployments and many of my friendships faded with time along with this.
3. Fell in love while in, and regrettably turned out he was married. It ruined my rep and I had to leave. Lost friends of course there too, or perhaps realized I didn’t really have any.
4. Decided to be empathic to above asshole’s situation (it was a marriage for citizenship)and paid the price several times over for this, as his facade faltered over the years. This cost me friends and family and ruined my self confidence and sense of self worth.
5. I moved out of the state for work after graduating to get out of a dead end job and start a career with the education I’d managed to obtain. Lost more friends in some pretty spectacularly disappointing ways - some as petty as asking them to pay their portion of a cell phone bill as I struggled fanatically myself, and some family died in the interim. 
5.1 Married my childhood love and lost the respect of the adopted family I once called mine - because I “stole him” when I moved. So much to the point that they begged him not to marry me.
6. Made some no contact choices because of toxicity to stop the panic attacks with what life line relationships I had left - the desperation for contact was not worth the strife and punishment to foster it.
7. Made friends and close to family in the new place, but had a child. We moved back so my husband could have his family, and our child could know what was left of hers. This family tolerates me at best, but it’s clear I am not welcome nor valued in that space.
8. I am in a management role with a young child to care for and no opportunity to foster relationships. But at this point, I get the feeling that I lack friends not just because I am not in a position to have them, but rather because people do not see me as someone they’d care to engage with. 

I often get the distinct feeling that no one wants me around unless they get something out of it - sex, money, leverage, work related assistance, etc. I run myself into the ground for people for little to know reason hoping for value in some one’s eyes, I’ve come to realize perhaps it’s because I was only valued if I was quiet, did what I was told, and did chores as a child. No time was ever spent together to just - be together, as a family. Perhaps this is why I fail here now, with no example of how to just be. I’ve often wondered if I ever had the skillset to make a true friend - and it must be a skill, because I fail at it horribly. As a result I feel empty and the face I put on for my family is getting harder and harder to fake. I don’t know what to do - and no clubs, meetups, etc aren’t the answer here, though I appreciate the advisement to do so.

I just don’t know what to do, and while on paper in my nuclear family, it’s a successful life, the loneliness and lack of support is driving me into a hollow suit of a person who now just makes the perfunctory moves to appear present and engaged for their sakes and theirs alone. Or I’d likely be gone.

However, every day feels like my normal day to day is slowly slipping out from under my fingertips.

depressed over my nose,"This is the first time i post on a forum but i hope i will feel better if i let this out. When i was young i had an accident where i fell with my head on the ground and broke my nose. This lead to disformed unnatural nose with a huge droopy bulbous tip. It also has a hump and its overall huge. I ve been bullied because of this during school by boys and girls with the most humiliating unhuman ways. The people that i consider friends also mocked me, even my own father once told me ''how did your nose grow up this way'' and it hurts since today. During this period as a teenager i tried to use all this pain as fuel to succeed in school, so i could prove both to myself and others that i am more than just a deformed characteristic. And it worked, i got into the best university in my country and was succesfull. That time my nose didnt bother me so much because I believed (pushed myself to believe) that I can be happy in life only with what I accomplish. Today, six years after school, nothing has changed. I cant look myself in the mirror without getting depressed or even panick attacks, and whenever someone takes a photo of me I feel like i want to die. As a 24 year old male I have urges to talk to women (I wish i didnt) but thats just impossible when I cant even see myself in the mirror , and remembering when I was younger how girls mocked me and laughed at my face because of this. The last months have been the worst , depression kicked in hard and my nose has become an obsession, I think of it every minute , I dont want to leave my room and be around other people with this deformed thing in the middle of my face. I opened up to my mother today beacause she understood I am depressed for the past few months and I made her cry after explaining to her how I hate my life and myself and  how people have treated me since i was a teenager. I will never forgive myself for making her cry, but i tried to keep this to myself and she wouldnt let me. So, i ve come to the sad but true conclusion that the only thing that matters in life is looks, I can win the nobel prize and still people will identify me for my hidious deformed nose. I think everyday of getting a nosejob but I am ashamed of what people will say, not the ones that bullied me but the ones that actually liked me as a friend. I hope one day I get the surgery and be able to look myself in the mirror and stop feeling like a decease. But even if I do im concerned that no woman would like to engage in a relationship with a man that has lived his life since he was 25+ like this. I just hope I never fell and broke it. For the last year what i once used as a fuel to succeed in life has become an obsession that doesnt let me concentrate in anything and keeps me depressed, because i cant fool myself anymore into believing that i can be happy in life just by studing hard and getting good grades, I have social and romantic needs, which i wish i didnt have but i do as a human being.Overall, im tired of this fucked up world and all this people that hurted me so bad so i prefer staying in my room forever and not interacting with anyone. For all the people out there that feel this way and have experienced  the same pain I have, i want you to know I feel you and I truly wish you the best. ","That's honestly a sad story. Im sorry you gone through this bullying. I cant give you any advice unfortunately but I am here to say that many people in this subreddit feel the same way for different reasons. Many people (mostly guys) in her didnt had a relationship their whole life. I am no exception. There are many that feel your pain, or at least a bit of it. Honestly, I would do the surgery. This seems to have a extreme effect on your self esteem.  Good luck.  || When I was a boy I was in an accident that crushed my left knee causing me to walk with a noticeable limp.

I cope by imagining im a superhero,"Not quite as the caption says, but almost.

For starters, I’d like to clarify that im in my last year of high-school.

Whenever I feel upset or bad, I begin to imagine that im a superhero, and that I have cool superpowers with my friends (people i made up) and that people look up to my determination, and will to never give up.

But when that fantasy cracks, and im forced to take a look at myself, I see that im nothing like that at all. I see that I could never be the hero that I imagine.

All my peers are getting jobs, driving, going out with friends, and enjoying their best years. Meanwhile, I’ve struggled so much to even feel like im a kid, and not just a whiny adult with no will to change. 

When the fantasy leaves, I realize how pathetic I am, and just how much I could never be that hero, that isn’t selfish. The hero that always helps others, and the hero that never gives up no matter the odds.

The truth is that my few friends barely even talk to me, I can’t do anything consistently enough to make any progress, and im selfish enough to only think of myself.

I wanted to be that hero so bad. I really did. 

I hate the real me. And I hate how much I struggle to change even the littlest of things about myself. I know i’ll never be the hero.

Trouble with family at home,"I live with a rather big family and been having trouble with one of my younger family members. They tend to disrespect me then when I confront them about it they’ll get even meaner. It all started off as verbal but as of late it has taken on a physical form as well. I have a lot of health issues so I go to the doctor a lot but at times I find it hard to cover the bruises from that family member. Due to my health issues I’m not really able to defend myself all that well. Like I’m in physical therapy and my family member will make sure to hit me right where I’m being treated. 

When I try to tell my family about it they just tell me they’re just a kid and I shouldn’t be fighting with a kid. They don’t understand it’s not typical arguing but aggressive and antagonizing. I also don’t know get why I’m blamed for not wanting to stand there and take it without compliant. Despite the physical aspect some of the mean stuff that family says really hurts. Like wishes of me dying and disappearing since I’m an inconvenience to the family and that they can’t wait for me to go away and never come back. Usually most won’t be bothered by it but things like that tend to get to me but when I try to tell my family about it they say it’s what kids say and not to take it personal. 

I don’t ever hear of other families going to through this so I feel alone in my experience. I’m moving out for college next month so I’m glad to be able to get away from it all even for just a little while.

"Despair, can someone help me what to do","I apologize for my post already. I have a breakdown and don't know what to do, really. 

I got diagnosed with depression at 15 and got medication and a bit of therapy. But then I got a bit happier again somehow...or I just accepted it, whatever happened. It helped slightly. But not enough. Then I stopped the meds. And I got worse. So I took them again. And this switched every few months. Now since a family member died I got some again, took them, they are now mostly finished and I don't get new ones. 

They tell me I feel too good to get meds. While I'm breaking down every second day. It is worse. I turn 18 in a few days and I see absolutely no future. It is even worse now. I get told I'm an adult and responsible for myself. I get called lazy and should be ashamed of myself. Useless is what I am. And I feel like it too. I hate myself. I wish I wouldn't. I can be so thankful for my life. 

Why am I so sad. I don't understand. I get told I need to go to therapy if I think my life is bad like this and if I do I will have to wait half a year or more for a place there. I am really crumbling but I'm scared I get locked up there. And the fact that I have to tell the therapist my whole life...I likely lie. 

Because some things are related to people in my life I still am close with. And I don't want to talk bad about them. Even if it is the truth. I don't believe myself anymore and I am totally isolated and distant from existense. What do I do guys...what do I do...does it sound bad or am I just overreacting...

Things may not get better.

Romantic love is not a guarantee in life.

Therapy is not a one size fits all however helpful it could be and that relies so much on the therapist themselves. There are a lot of terrible therapists, it seems.

Have I got depression or am I just sad?,"Hello, I am a 23 year old female. I have an online business of things I make myself them sell on Etsy & eBay as a way of making money. I stay at home most days, as a lot of my family are severely disabled, and need 24/7 care. I do all the cooking (sometimes over 22 cooked meals a day), the washing, household chores ect.

I’ve always suffered with really bad anxiety, and also have always thought I have OCD, as I have a lot of the characteristics of it. I’ve always gone from periods of times when I’ve just felt sad & anxious, but over the past few months it’s intensified dramatically.

Last year I was diagnosed with FND, which Ik has affected me mentally without even perhaps realising at times. My Mum (who I absolutely adore, and would simply not be able to survive without) was diagnosed with cancer in March, although has been told it’s gone now with no further treatment. I don’t know if a mixture of these things have caused these feeling or not????

Lately I feel completely worthless, useless, miserable and like there is no point in carrying on. These feeling can last anywhere between days to hours but they are so intense. More intense than I have ever felt before. Sometimes I feel like I have to carry on because there are so many people relying on me to survive, which is often what keeps me going as ik they wouldn’t be able to cope if I wasn’t there to do the work around the house.

I feel especially with my diagnosis that my life is over, and I’m a total failure, I feel like I can never do anything wrong, everyone hates me, and everyone is waiting to just slag me off. I feel like I will forever be a burden on people and will end up permanently disabled (even though rationally ik there is no real reason for this). I have nothing to look forward to, only that everything will keep getting worse.

Sometimes I can feel ok. Occasionally even happy, but the feelings of overwhelming sadness, hopelessness and overthinking, almost like mood swings? It’s hard to describe but when I get into these moods/ feelings it’s just so so intense and consumes me.

I feel like I can’t talk to anyone as everyone is always so busy or have more important things going on in their lives. I honestly don’t know if maybe this is an intense OCD or anxiety episode or if I am depressed, hormonal, or just sad about life. Could anyway please offer me some advice about what they thing, and how I can move forward if I even can. ","You sound pretty depressed but I'm not surprised reading your post.

não deixo me levar por crises e devaneios profundos que me faz desconectar de quem sou, então, eu sei, se isso fosse possível acabar, o que restaria de mim, seria eu mesma, só que sem esse imenso vazio e medo. || Eu só não sei o que é não sentir tanto medo, eu acho. É parte fundamental de mim. Você cresce se moldando pra uma versão personalizada da sua cabeça do que você imagina que cada pessoa gostaria de ver em um amigo, e com o tempo, você esquece de desenvolver a sua própria identidade. É como se a minha personalidade fosse só a insegurança intermediária entre uma máscara e a próxima. Eu acho que deve ser por isso, inclusive, que eu não consigo manter nem 5 minutos de conversa com alguém desconhecido. Eu cresci dependendo em ver do que as pessoas gostam e tentando me encaixar pra agradar elas, e quando eu não tenho noção prévia das preferências de alguém, eu fico horrorizado com a noção de ser desinteressante ou descartável. Eu não sei o que restaria de mim sem essa disfunção porque eu me deixei levar tanto por ela que esqueci de crescer além.

(Desculpa roubar seu post como mini terapia, eu me deixei levar, mas tô precisando de vez em quando) || já me identifiquei muito com isso.
fiz inúmeras coisas porque os OUTROS queriam que eu fizesse, porque isso me tornaria legal e descolada e, finalmente, me encaixaria em alguma tribo. isso quando se é adolescente faz total sentido e só intensifica quando se tem algum tipo de transtorno, ainda mais um que te desconecta de você e te coloca como um lixo.
achava que nunca seria digna de nada, nem de amor, nem de atenção, nem de amigos, pois eu sabia quem eu era, do que gostava, mas ninguém estava lá para compartilhar desses mesmos gostos que você.
o que restava era uma adolescência miserável, na qual você tentava se encaixar em um monte de coisa aleatória, mas que nunca se sentia pertencente. 
hoje em dia, prefiro ser adepta a essa solitude de entender que existe um eu por trás de todas as máscaras que colocava para me pertencer e, de maneira mais especial, alguém com sonhos, com vida e com o mínimo de esperança, por trás de uma porcaria de transtorno",1753743229.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbv1x6/solidão/,depression

"Ive been depression free for almost a year, why is it coming back?","What do I do about this? I've finally felt what happiness is and it's fading from me. So slowly that I almost didn't notice. About 2 months ago I went to the doctor to get my sertraline dose up and it's done nothing. I don't know what to do. I'm 16f and I feel like my parents aren't caring. Which is weird because they cared so much when I was ill previously. I've been to hospital several times and I've needed stitches and stuff and they were usually (not always) very supportive. But now that it's coming back it's like they don't want to know. The relief they must've felt when I started healing it's like they don't want it to go to waste and they don't want to do it all over again so they just ignore, pretend it's not happening. They tell me to get active, I am. They tell me to do things to help myself, I do. I do all the things that i did when I was healed. I shower every day and i get dressed, I leave my room and house and I keep my room clean, i look after myself in all ways I can but it doesn't help despite what my parents have drilled into my head.

I'm already grieving my happiness and school will be starting in a month, I'm 1 year clean from sh and scared I won't be able to keep that up if I'm still feeling this way by the time school starts.

Life has made a sudden turn for the better!,"So just a summary of the past three years, my step-father blew his brains out, I had to clean it up, became an alcoholic, my fiance left me, moved to another state, hate the people, hated every job, spiraled to the bottom, saw a therapist and doctor, got Prozac and sleeping pills, feeling better, got a job I actually like. Fuck. ""You must be this low to ride this ride"" would be the name of this chapter. 

But! After three weeks on Prozac and being able to sleep without alcohol, it has done immeasurable good for my mental health. I think the Prozac will take a few weeks more, but just being able to sleep has done wonders for my mental health. Alcoholism is a beast. I self medicated to stave off insomnia. After four days without sleep, things get bad. And not having health insurance, I figured seeing a doctor was out of my reach. Everything costs about $500 (doctors visit, Prozac, anti drinking magic pills, and sleeping stuff (I won't go into details)). 

If your in the same situation I was (still am) in, the best thing you can do is see a doctor. Explain your situation and don't hold back. Tell them everything. Lying will only do you harm. 

Anyway, that's not the point I'm trying to make. 

I just got a job that I love! It's not the sort of job people aspire to. In fact, if you told me five years ago that I'd be ecstatic about stocking milk, I probably would have shot myself.

I've worked in the service industry for most of my life. And anyone who has done so knows how soul crushing it can be. Day after day, shitty, narcissistic customers, drug addled coworkers... the list goes on. 

But now my job is to put gallons of milk on a shelf. There are a few other minor things I have to do, but that's basically it! I'm alone in a giant walk-in, with nothing but my thoughts or an audiobook, and I couldn't be happier. I'm surrounded by giant fans so whatever noise I make is drowned out! I'm experimenting with all my voices, making up stories, singing, dancing! I do stand up comedy, and this is the perfect space for me to practice and create. I never would have thought this job would bring me such joy.

To close, here's a story about a Farmer and his son:

One day in late summer, an old farmer was working in his field with his old sick horse. The farmer felt compassion for the horse and desired to lift its burden. So he left his horse loose to go the mountains and live out the rest of its life.

Soon after, neighbors from the nearby village visited, offering their condolences and said, ""What a shame.  Now your only horse is gone.  How unfortunate you are!. You must be very sad. How will you live, work the land, and prosper?"" The farmer replied: ""Who knows? We shall see"".

Two days later the old horse came back now rejuvenated after meandering in the mountainsides while eating the wild grasses. He came back with twelve new younger and healthy horses which followed the old horse into the corral.

Word got out in the village of the old farmer's good fortune and it wasn't long before people stopped by to congratulate the farmer on his good luck.  ""How fortunate you are!"" they exclaimed. You must be very happy!""  Again, the farmer softly said, ""Who knows? We shall see.""

At daybreak on the next morning, the farmer's only son set off to attempt to train the new wild horses, but the farmer's son was thrown to the ground and broke his leg.  One by one villagers arrived during the day to bemoan the farmer's latest misfortune.  ""Oh, what a tragedy!  Your son won't be able to help you farm with a broken leg. You'll have to do all the work yourself, How will you survive? You must be very sad"".  they said.  Calmly going about his usual business the farmer answered, ""Who knows? We shall see""

Several days later a war broke out. The Emperor's men arrived in the village demanding that young men come with them to be conscripted into the Emperor's army.  As it happened the farmer's son was deemed unfit because of his broken leg.  ""What very good fortune you have!!"" the villagers exclaimed as their own young sons were marched away. ""You must be very happy."" ""Who knows? We shall see!"", replied the old farmer as he headed off to work his field alone.

As time went on the broken leg healed but the son was left with a slight limp. Again the neighbors came to pay their condolences. ""Oh what bad luck. Too bad for you""!  But the old farmer simply replied; ""Who knows? We shall see.""

As it turned out the other young village boys had died in the war and the old farmer and his son were the only able bodied men capable of working the village lands. The old farmer became wealthy and was very generous to the villagers. They said: ""Oh how fortunate we are, you must be very happy"", to which the old farmer replied, ""Who knows? We shall see!""

Life is a lot. Am I happy? Fuck no. But I'm happy about some things. I'm still healing, and fighting depression will always be a part of my life, but there is something worth fighting for, even if we can't see it. Take care of your broken selves for the person you'll be tomorrow. 

If anyone wants to talk, I'm open. There's nothing weak about seeking help. Take care.","Dude. Fuck yeah! This is actually exactly what I believe contentment is (not happiness bc I think happiness is a more temporary state of being that shouldn’t be pedestalized as much as it is) you found what it is that makes you content for yourself, not what everything else around you tells you to want.

"neverending grief, lost hope","I'm 24 and I've been on antidepressants for 5 years now but medicated and dealing with mental health in general since 15 years old so you could imagine that I'm used to not feeling well basically. I'm a sad and nostalgic person diagnosed with multiple things along with depression, you know the deal.

My issue is, I cannot handle grief. I'm not saying that the rest of the world handles grief with grace and gets over it quickly, but I just cannot deal with the concept of death and loss, it's something that pushes me into a dark abyss each time I think I might be getting better and the only thing that I can think of is: I hope I die right now so I stop feeling like this and I don't care if I get over this, because this will happen again. So I feel hopeless.

Earlier this year my 7 month old kitten was killed by a dog and till this day I can't stop crying about her. I got her to gain some kind of purpose? in my life (you know, something else to do apart from the job I hate), she was everything I ever dreamed of, and it was abruptly taken away from me. And violently. And bloody. And I saw everything. And I was alone. I can't stop thinking about it, I can't stop dreaming about that moment and feeling guilty about it. 

I talk about this with my therapist almost every session and the thing she told me is that I need to start remembering her in a good way, like the good memories I had with her, but each time i try to even think about the goofy things she did the violent scenario I lived interrupts the nice and warm feeling of her memory. 

I need to talk about her. I want to talk about her. I need to keep her alive in my mind, but for some reason I don't think is healthy anymore. I try to not compare myself but it is inevitable. I feel like im overreacting by being this sad about a cat (which I know it has way more meaning) when there are people who lost their children?? I just don't understand why I cannot stop being sad about my cat. She died on Feb this year. Is this amount of sad normal? What can I do? My psych has tripled my sertraline since my cat died. 

I feel so vulnerable because I know for a fact that this will happen again. My dog will die. My parents will die. Everyone I ever cared of will die. So what's the point? I don't think I'm made for this type of suffering. I don't want this. I don't want to get over this, I just don't want to deal with this at all. Does that make sense? I don't think I'm built for grief like the rest of the world is, I never get over things. I'm still grieving things that happened when I was 12. 

I feel like living is jumping from suffering to suffering, and I don't feel like the good moments (because there are really good moments in life) compensate the shitty ones, so I feel hopeless and I don't really want to participate in life anymore. I just don't like this. I need advice.",,1753736211.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbs5hl/neverending_grief_lost_hope/,depression
Struggling my whole life,"For the past 18 years of my life I have watched every ounce of love I had for anything disappear. I feel empty and without direction. The only reason I really do things anymore is to prevent myself from getting in trouble. For so much of my life, I realized I wasted it away attempting to find someone who would fall in love with me. Most things I do or have ever done have involved at least a little bit of hope that someone will notice me.

I feel extreme guilt for the way I handled my grandmothers death. I was at the beach with my family when I learned she was put in hospice. I wish I knew her better. She was so kind and the things I know about her now make me regret never calling her. I was about 14 or 15 and I never had someone die before. Now I see my other grandparents getting older and it’s terrible. I know death is closer than I think, but my mind is always so occupied with imaginary situations of things being better that I forget to call them or ever respond to them. I feel terrible. 

I’m an attractive person, something which I am so happy about because it took me a really long time to get to where I am. But despite this, I have a terrible porn addiction. I realized last year I watch porn out of a desire to ruin myself. I know the terrible effects, and I keep on indulging myself because of both the dopamine rush and the belief that despite my looks may never be enough for someone. The things I watch have only gotten worse as the inner hatred grows. I know it’s both terrible for me and terrible in general. I hate it all and I hate that I keep doing it, but it’s familiar and I don’t have much familiarity. I used to think I was really good at handling change, but I think I’m so used to it that as long as there’s something to cling on to, good or bad, I won’t feel lost again.

I’m pretty sure my parents divorced because my dad was having an affair. Despite things being relatively okay between them, moving back and forth from house to house is exhausting. I have two rooms which don’t feel like home. I have to push myself to clean them. I sit in the shower and either bring my phone in and keep it out of the water or stare at the shower head. My showers can last 1-2 hours and my parents have given up on trying to make them shorter.

There was a moment when I went to my summer camp and I found this really scratchy old sweater at a thrift store. It was purple and I wore it every day for a week. I’m not sure why, but that was the only thing that ever made me feel safe. I left it by accident and I never really recovered. It made me feel pretty, and it made me warm when the nights were really cold there. 

I had a dream where I was a girl. I can remember it really well. It kinda hurts to think about. Gender has always been a confusing thing for me. I don’t know what I want to be or what I want to look like anymore. Everything seems inspired by whatever movies I’m watching. 

I’ve never told anybody about any of this. I have a therapist I’ve been seeing for a year and I could never bring myself to tell her. I’m so afraid of what people will think about me. I’m riddled with guilt and self hatred. I think the worst part is that when I hate myself, I act pragmatically and logically. I try to point out flaws and back them up with evidence. 

I’ve dated many people. Nearly all of them said they couldn’t date me because they weren’t attracted to me. They said I was extremely kind and they wanted to be friends but none of that ever worked out. No relationship lasted longer than 2 months, and I keep running into all of my exes at parties and so I find a bathroom and cry then pretend everything’s fine.

I know it’s depression, and I know it’s not real, but happiness is so rare. My phone is like a numbing agent, and I can just get lost in the lights and the sounds. I hope things get better. I hope I find that purple sweater. I hope my grandmas aren’t hurt. I hope I can’t find someone who really wants to be with me. I hope I can figure out who I am, and I hope I can open up to someone with no shame or hatred or shock.

TLDR: people always say I have sad eyes and I try to laugh it off every time, but unless I have a plan I sit inside all day on my phone and wish everything was different. ",,1753735673.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbrwyw/struggling_my_whole_life/,depression

"I can't stop grieving my mother's passing, even though it hasn't happened yet.","A few days ago I watched a YouTube video. It was just some recap of a short story by Isaac asimov, called ""the last answer."" I don't know what it was, but it caused me to spiral. I'm 21 now, almost 22, and the concept of mortality finally fully hit me. I've been thinking about how old my dog is, and how she has maybe a year left. Or my mom, whos around 54, and how her time is closing in as well. I spent so much of my life resenting her for things she has done, most of which brought on by her own trauma. I feel like I've avoided loving her for so long. And now that it's processed that one day she'll leave me, and I can't stop crying. Our relationship is better now than it was, much better, but I still can't shake my guilt. I know realistically I have a long time left, and she also has a good chunk, but I can't stop thinking about the end. I can't figure out how to go back to living in the moment. I learned that time only goes by faster as you age, and I am beyond terrified. There's a pit in my chest, and the more I think about the end the more time seems to fly. This past week has felt like a blur and an eternity. I'm so young. I'm so, so young. It's not fair that I'm feeling like this. It's just not fair. In all honesty, a lobotomy sounds nice right now. 

I'm sorry for the shitty formatting, and for the rant. I think i just need to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. I find it so perplexing how flagrantly death is treated. I know it's inevitable, but the fear of losing the people I love and the possibility of not being able to say goodbye is so fucking scary. I don't even think I'm afraid of death.

If you need someone to speak to I am on Reddit most days and will reply to anyone || There are no words || look up internet definitions from websites that inspire confidence such as wikipedia. or documentaries on depression. stuff like that. Explaining alone almost never works. || In my experience, there isn't any way to explain it or get folks to understand. 

I'm pretty sure even my therapist underestimated how bad my depression was.

My closest friends and family have no idea. I tell them and they don't understand. || No real answer for that, honestly. I get people to take it seriously because I often just disappear, and I'm very open about having been institutionalized twice at 16, so the stigma about asylums and stuff does the work for me. And even then, people who haven't gone through depression or had their feelings invalidated by others won't really understand, and they'll most likely just think you're just a little sad and lonely. That's usually where those religious preachers try to take you to a church.

If you want them to know, you can just be open about it, and if they don't get it, then it's not worth the effort to explain.

I believe that therapy and meds are just meant to supress it for a while, the healing work and everything literally depends on our own selves, nobody else can heal us except ourselves, harsh truth.

Feeling nothing,"I am a 27-year-old woman. I’ve been struggling with depression for at least 6 years. Two doctors diagnosed me and prescribed antidepressants, but for some reason I was afraid to take them. I kept hoping it would go away on its own because I thought like it wasn’t that bad...

I think it all started after years of stress, lack of sleep, and a poor diet during university. Something happened to my health tbh, I’m not exactly sure what but my blood tests got worse, my hormones went crazy, I lost my period, and my FT3 levels became very low.

Because of that, I was constantly sad and emotionally unstable. I often had thoughts about not wanting to live, and the only thing that kept me going was my family. I cried or screamed all the time, usually for no big reason, even during sensitive (for me) conversations. Everything made me anxious, my body reacted with huge stress and sweating over the smallest things.

Eventually, I found a doctor who decided to cfix my FT3 levels. I started taking synthetic T3 (Liothyronine), and my mental health improved a bit. I’m no longer as sensitive, I get angry anymore, I don’t cry, and I don’t get stressed as easily.

But now I’ve noticed something else, I don’t feel anything. Nothing. Empty. It’s like my emotions have been switched off. I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt happiness- that warm feeling in my heart. I don’t feel love or joy. I’ve completely lost my libido. I don’t react at all when a guy touches me, hugs me, or kisses me.

I’ve also become very distracted and unmotivated. I can’t focus on anything. I stay stuck in my comfort zone. My whole life I used to be ambitious (I’m an engineer in mathematics), and I had lots of hobbies. I could sit and focus on one task for hours. Now that’s gone. I feel like a mess.

I have no idea what happened to me or how to fix it. I really don’t want to lose more years of my life. I already feel like I’m years behind my friends and other people my age.

I realized that maybe I should start taking the right medication. I wonder if anyone here has gone through something similar, and what kind of medication helped. I’ve heard that some antidepressants can make this feeling of emptiness even worse, and that scares me. I am planning to go see a doctor but I also try to understand what is going on","I know how you feel. I'm a musician, and music was my world. Gigging, going to gigs, writing, recording, and playing my instruments. Now, I don't even listen to music, let alone do any of the above things.

I went to see Oasis last month... and the closer to the date I got, the less excited I was about going.

I lack so much motivation it's painful.

I don't enjoy gaming, matching movies or TV shows.

I just prefer to do nothing.

I have a good job, I'm well paid, and I worked really hard to get it. But I'd give it up tomorrow just so I could be on my own.

I lost my job. Due to bad mental health and lack of money i don‘t have a drivers license so its practically impossible for me to find a new job. I live in a rural area.

I have no insurance because of some stupid loophole. And as I live in a country where 99 percent of people are automatically insured there is no such thing as free healthcare for anyone who isnt insured.
ADHD and autism don‘t make life easier either and in a few days I need to send over pictures of my apartment to another insurance company in hopes of getting some money (because of the fire) but my flat is completely trashed because just surviving has been impossibly hard. But if I don‘t not only will I not get any insurance money but my landlord will have someone come over to inspect the place and the way it‘s looking atm I know he will immediately kick me out.
I have no real support system. No family. A few friends who know I‘m struggling but none of them is in a position to support me with anything besides words.

The first two weeks of August will be full of party. I just want to rot alone and die.,"In the first two weeks of August, I will be attending 5 birthdays, including my own.

I'll be attending the farewell party of a close friend who'll start her masters abroad. I'll be attending the ceremony where I will be lauded for having graduated as  top #1 of my class in aerospace engineering.


I wish to go to exactly zero of these places. I want to stay alone in my room. In fact, I want to kill myself.


I think I have gender dysphoria. I have no idea how the fuck did this idea get so ingrained in my brain, but this fucking bitch that controls my cognition just accepted it as being true. I had no problems with my identity before, and in a matter of mere weeks this spaghetti fucking mess decides that it feels more comfortable as a woman rather than my biological assigned gender. Yes, it is true, I indulged in play with my sister during childhood. Yes, it is true, I am pathologically more sensitive than the average male. Yes, it is true, I have had problems with not conforming to whatever the """"alpha male ideal"""" behavior is in my life. I'd say, even with all of that, looking rationally from outside, most of my strengths are male-typical. But, oh, my brain doesn't care. The mush in my head thinks it's a fucking woman now.


I despise and reject this feeling. I don't want to undergo HRT. I don't want to mutilate my genitals. I don't want to become a 2nd class citizen. That is NOT an option for me, and even less of an option in the culture and social circle I was raised in. But I don't want to accept the possibility that the prenatal hormonal environment or whatever did not appropriately differentiate my brain with that of my gonadal sex before I was even fucking born. I cannot accept that biology would give me that big of a middle finger. I want to feel comfortable with the body that was given to me. I want a neurosurgeon to access my hypothalamus and my BSTc and place an electrode and manually inject the fucking testosterone that was not given to me when it should have. Maybe that way I don't feel like a fucking f4g all the fucking time. Or just fucking sever that shit altogether and that way my brain becomes genderless and I don't have to care about this stupid identity crisis.


I am sick of this. The solution I want is clear in concept, but if I tell anyone they'll think I have become insane. My psychiatrist told me I may have OCD, but I'm not sure it's the case. Either way there's something genetic fucking people up in this family because I see my auntie, a law school graduate, living in an abandoned house with an overgrown garden with no job. She could not just be lazy and unmotivated. My older brother, an electrical eng, also valedictorian like me, is basically non-verbal at this point.

I thought I was better. I’m definitely in a better place, but I can feel how easy it would be to slip back into that horrible state. 

Sometimes I come home after a fantastic day, where I had been in a good mood and felt fulfilled, and everything turns dark. Suddenly, I wonder why I’m doing all this, living.

But We can find ways to live with it. We can find ways to see the joys of life despite it. It *will* get better. It may also get worse before it gets better too.

Stop telling yourself you can’t because if you tell yourself you can’t, you won’t.

I feel like depression is ruining my relationship,"I 22F am with an amazing man 22M. I genuinely see a future with this person but we both have depression and it gets really difficult to maintain our relationship. Sometimes when he’s depressed he isolates and sometimes I can feel him slipping away and it scares me deeply. I feel like my immediate response is to turn to him when I feel depressed but a lot of times when we hang out I just find myself feeling numb and not wanting to go out and do anything. He’ll even ask me why I feel sad around him all the time and I just feel so guilty. I want to be close to him, I want to feel happy, and I want him to feel happy. It sucks because I love him so much but I feel like our depression is just pushing each other away. I feel like his isolation pushes me away and my constant dark could pushes him away. Sometimes I feel like he’d rather be with his friends or alone than be with me because I can be such a bummer but I feel like those actions push me away further and make me more numb because I just feel guilt. It hurts a lot and I’m not sure what to do.  
I try and work out, eat well, see friends, do hobbies and i’m in therapy but everything just makes me feel so empty. I just want to have a happy relationship like we once did but we’re stuck in a loop. I don’t want to put the burden of my emotions on him because he has his own problems to face. And I don’t want to lose myself in my relationship either.

Vent,"I've been in a clinical depression for more than 3 years now. I've tried to find online solutions to assist me but so far all of them have basically been useless. I've not told my parents because I'd can only handle so much babying and I'd hate for our relationship to change, if anything it would probably make it worse for me. I would say I'm suicidal but honestly I'm too much of a coward to act upon it in reality but just the general thoughts have been interfering with day to day life. Do not feel the need to respond this is just me venting.","Don’t be ashamed of wanting to vent. I’m honestly in a similar position.

Professional help,"I have reached a point in my life where I have realized that I can no longer get anywhere on my own. There is nothing left of my former, adventurous, outgoing self. Since the end of last year, I've been living in seclusion and, when I'm not working (which works, albeit very exhaustingly, because I know that without a job I have a problem), I waste my entire life. I don't enjoy anything anymore, the smallest tasks are extremely overwhelming, if something doesn't go the way I want it to - no matter how trivial it is - I get incredibly angry. I avoid contact with my family and friends and when I do go out, it's also a huge task for me. My apartment is falling into disrepair, I can no longer manage the simplest household tasks, for example the last time I vacuumed was a few months ago or I sleep in an unmade bed because I can't bring myself to make it. I just waste my days off sitting in front of the PlayStation, watching reels on my cell phone or watching YouTube videos, even though I don't really feel like doing that either. My ex-girlfriend was still understanding until the end, tried to give me peace and space and even went on vacation with her aunt a few weeks ago because I didn't feel up to it. Of course, it also sapped her strength in the long run and we split up a few days ago. Since then, despite my endless sadness, I've somehow got a “burst of energy” (out of panic?). I want to get my life and my apartment back on track, I want to enjoy life again. It's only now that I've really realized just how bad the situation actually is.

Now the question: Who has ever been in a similar situation? What has helped? What is rather counterproductive? What would be an approach to possibly seeking professional help? If you would like to know anything else, please feel free to ask. Thank you!

I’m only alive because of my wife and daughter.,"I’ve been on every medication under the sun, including ketamine. Nothing works. I went through a very traumatic event when I was 12 years old, and for a while I was ok, but it caught up with me and my brain has just given up. It’s like it just turned off. I don’t even feel real anymore. 

I’m 31 one now, and I’ve been dealing with major depressive disorder for over 10 years now. I’ve had multiple therapists give up on me, my psychiatrist doesn’t know what to do anymore. I wish we were further along in treatment for depression as a society. 

I used to be such a motivated, happy person. Everything that makes a human being a human being, has been stripped from me. I haven’t felt an emotion in years. I’m just blank. A void. I wouldn’t wish this suffering on anyone. ","Many chronically depressed people feel the same way. Sending you hugs stranger.

Girl who hates herself to death,"Every single day, I (f26) feel this unbearable urge to do something reckless, something I could never undo. It’s like a shadow whispering in my ear, reminding me that I’m trapped in a life I can’t escape. I can’t bring myself to believe that anyone truly loves me beyond my family’s obligation to do so. It feels like my entire existence has been a cycle of being used, broken, and discarded by people who only ever saw me as something to take from. And the worst part is, I can’t even hate them for it because deep down I blame myself. I feel like I was born for this, born to be nothing more than someone others exploit until there’s nothing left. That thought doesn’t just hurt. It devours me piece by piece until I can barely breathe.

I hate myself with every fiber of my being. I hate myself so much that I don’t even think I’d want to be friends with me if I met myself as a stranger. And it’s not about my looks, because ironically, I actually think I look good. People tell me that all the time. But it doesn’t matter, because beauty means nothing when your soul feels rotten. I hate my personality. I hate my mind. I hate the life I was given and the person I’ve become. I hate every single part of myself until there’s nothing left to hate. I have so little respect for myself now that I feel like I’m barely even human anymore. I feel worthless, like a ghost walking through life without purpose, without hope, without anything.

Sometimes I think about dying, but I’m too terrified to even try. Maybe that makes me a coward. Maybe it makes me weak. I’ve hated myself my entire life, but when 2020 came, it was like something inside me broke completely. The hatred got louder, sharper, more cruel. And I can’t make it stop. I’ve been fighting for so long, screaming silently for something to change, but the feeling never leaves. It clings to me like a curse. What are you supposed to do when your own existence feels like a prison? Is it better to just give up and let it all end, or to keep fighting when every day feels like another slow death? Because I swear, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. 

I even “dream” about being raped, that’s how little respect I have for myself. Is that normal?
","I'm tired of all of this too, of all of those people. It's not our fault that people treat us this way, we both deserve better. We don't deserve to suffer and I hope you will see that too eventually. But I'm not sure if there's still anything of me left and I don't know how long I will last. My life feels hopeless and pointless too. I still sometimes have this stupid hope that something will change or that someone will save me, so I'm just rotting. You can't control your dreams, so I wouldn't worry about that too much, but it must be scary. I hope you start seeing more good things about yourself. || the grind of hate, self destruction is real a pain it hurt a but your worth so how more even if your family rejects you. I ve been there when I was younger but you can come out of it having a much better life. || That's a lot. And it's not normal, at least it shouldn't be normal. I think you deserve better than this. You are worthy of love and self respect. If you want to talk, we can talk. Or I will just listen but please stay alive. You seem like a honest person, that's a very good quality. I'm glad you told us about your thoughts and feelings, thank you. || i relate to this completely, especially the lack of self respect for myself. i'm so depressed and done with life that i seek some sort of thrill, to make me feel something. but not a good sort of thrill something dangerous.. it's weird because i have so much going for me still like im young and pretty yet i literally do not give a fuck about that at all because inside i'm literally fighting demons and no one even knows it. but it's comforting to know someone feels the exact same way. i do really hope life gets better for you girl, and i hope you know your not alone.. depression is a silent killer but so many have come out the other end. || The feeling like people only love you out of obligation? Shit man, that’s how it feels every day. I’m terrified of pain. That doesn’t make me a coward. It doesn’t make you a coward. It makes us human. I feel like I’ve been on autopilot for the last 5 years. I won’t say I get it because it’s different for everyone. 

Sometimes I drive so recklessly I feel guilty that I don’t feel guilty. Like if I crashed and died.. hey, I wouldn’t be alive to bear the consequences of my actions and the people I’ve harmed but you know who would? My family. And it doesn’t stop me. I constantly want to do some impulsive shit just to change the monotony i exist in. Do you feel the same? 

Maybe I want to do impulsive shit because then I could say I finally did something instead of nothing. And then I could have a real tangible reason to feel like a failure. It could show on the outside as much as it burns me up on the inside. 

I’d say the only difference is that I don’t hate myself. Well I do and I don’t. I see the life I could have and I still want it. It’s just, it’s like I’m in a room and I’m looking through the window at it. The door is locked and all I need is the key but like a dumbass I seem to have inconveniently misplaced it. || Might be a weird thing to say (I’ve never posted on or commented on Reddit before… typically just browse) but I’m glad you said something, because I feel the exact same way. Like eerily similar to what I came here working up the nerve to post. I’m also a female, 28 YO. 

Maybe it will help you to know you’re not the only one feeling like this? I guess I’m not one to give advice, because I can’t even seem to help myself… but I guess what I think I want (not that we are the same of course) is to just feel like I’m not a burden and that someone really does actually value me. 

Maybe do something for yourself/with your time that feels valuable? I typically try to do that through finding a way to serve other people. It’s sad maybe… but going out of my way to help someone in need helps me feel valuable. It’s definitely shitty that I am probably doing it more for myself than the people I’m helping… but whatever. It helps me feel better I guess. It’s definitely not a permanent fix, but it does sort of help. I’m talking helping build a house for habitat for humanity or something. Might help you make some good new friends too?

I’m sorry you feel this way, and I’m really sorry that you are to the point of feeling like posting anonymously online is the only way you can talk about it. I wish for you a good true friend who you can confide in/trust for good advice and help.

Have you tried talking to a professional? I have tried and if I’m honest it’s not really been the best experience in a few cases. But finding a good therapist can be a process (so I hear- I am still struggling to find a good one/stay consistent with visits honestly). I will say though that sometimes just having a sounding board of a person who can help give some solid advice, consolation, or even just a being a real person to listen while you break down how you’re actually doing has helped me a bit in the past. Not that it will fix things of course, but sometimes it just feels good to talk things out in general and can help bring you some personal clarity. Therapy can be expensive (not sure of your insurance situation/financials obviously) but hey if you’re willing to be reckless, then maybe recklessly book the best and most expensive therapist you can find to see if they can help you. Fuck it, right?

You do deserve help, you do deserve respect (from yourself and others), and you certainly are someone of value who doesn’t deserve to feel this way. I don’t know you at all obviously, but your post seems intelligent/well written and shows emotional awareness.

Best wishes to you. Stay alive and maybe find some “constructive” ways to be reckless that contribute to your healing. Go have some fun, do some self care/pampering, book that therapy session, learn new things/go new places, meet new people, read some new books, buy something irresponsible you’ve always wanted. Whatever floats your boat. I know things cost money and I don’t want to seem like I’m suggesting you can just buy yourself happiness… but if you’re not even sure you like being alive, then I think you should try some new things out and invest in yourself. You just might find something you feel is worth living for, or find a new love for yourself and for life. Good luck friend. || Self destruction gets stronger the longer it goes on. After a night of depression to the point that i couldn’t sleep I had a dream that my family threw a party after they saw I killed myself which I don’t get because I don’t think my family would be happy about that. But I do think they have to love my because they’re family, I think if they were given the choice and saw what kind of fuck up I actually am, no one would waste their time around me. || I relate to you 27(F), I also hate myself enough, do not find reason to respect myself like I used to, it’s pathetic how I have turned out never imagined to be like this being ugly and depressed. Also I relate to family only loving us because of obligation, sometimes family causes harm other times care for us but that conflicts our internal understanding of safety and detachment from them. I understand that but I remember that quote from Mr. Robot series that say “People walk around like they know what hate means.” “Nah, no one does until you truly hate yourself. I mean truly hate yourself. That’s power.” I guess we can romanticize is as power because people cannot hurt us like we end up hurting ourselves. Though I hope you heal from this, maybe use this hate for something, turn it in to something. Stay around you are not weak or cowardly, maybe we can exist and wait natural death.",1753655922.0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mazqyy/girl_who_hates_herself_to_death/,depression
I am a terrible person. Not just morally but as just a functioning person,"I am a terrible person. Not just morally but as just a functioning person. I'm filthy. I didn't clean my house for  weeks and suddenly a maintenance person popped in. I was so ashamed it was disgusting. Dishes in the sink, for weeks, dishwasher full with bacteria growing inside the bathroom filthy filled with clothes all over. I was humiliated. I disgusted the man who came in. He took photos of the sink. He probably showed everyone. The garbage was so overrun he threw a piece of tissue in the sink. Water started running downstairs so he had to come in and fix it. 

I think was so noisy my neighbor moved out from under me. Im always home, fat, and up at night and the floor creek like crazy. I think She wanted to know who I was before I left. She said “I want to know if that's him” You can LOOK AT ME and  tell. Thank god her boyfriend stopped her. 

I went to school smelling like shit. Human shit like i shit on myself, so I left flight school after a short time.

 My car was so filthy the cops pulled me over and knew I looked like depression. He asked if I was okay and I teared up and almost broke down. 

I am in horrible shape. I smoke nonstop now. But I think I'm done. Treating my surroundings like trash. Being humiliated by my filth sadness and broke-ness. Needing to drink to deal with the day which destroys my already scatter brained mind and turn me into some type of semi “There ghoul”  Jesus Christ what the fuck is wrong with me. 

 I don't know a single person as bad as I am. I'm selfish for carrying myself like this, exposing myself to the world like this. It's like I have no self respect or dignity. Obese, fucked up hair, creepy.

 My other neighbor literally heard my therapy session. He knows I'm an alcoholic with social anxiety. I overheard him telling his friend.

 Every time I drink, my life becomes worse. My therapist said to write this down and remember it but I choose to ignore his advice. “I want to be able to drink but I'm afraid I can't handle it” 

You can't even do the basics in life.  Either I change today after all of this or my life will literally be a dumpster fire until the day I die. I pray I get a job in Alabama I got shortlisted for, tIt would be the best paying job I ever had. if i dont get it the, trucker job. If the  Trucking job doesn't work out, I will reenlist. No more junk or fast food. My life is a damn catastrophe.

I will Wait until Im somewhat healthy. And wash my damn clothes. Then get back into flight school.

I feel so miserable it feels like my head is about to split open," I'm genuinely losing my mind and I don't know what to do

It's an understatement to say that I feel horrible right now. I feel suffocated I'm losing my mind it's driving me crazy I wanna k1ll myself. I won't actually do it but my thoughts r getting worse I keep wanting to do smth damaging. I can't cry I have no control over anything. Everyday tasks are driving me crazy im angry and irritable everything is so difficult my sleep routine is an absolute mess I sleep around 4 and wake up 12 hours later all groggy and miserable.

 I even started a remote paid internship recently but quit it after a week because I couldn't wake up early every day and the work was overwhelming. I can't help but beat myself up over it. Everyone else does internships and jobs but why am I incapable of doing anything productive? I want money and I can't go a day without thinking and thinking about money and how I can earn it so I don't have to be so worried. And it's not irrational because I actually need it. Everything requires money.

I am overwhelmed byy sensory issues. My clothes make me uncomfortable. Sometimes I get such sensory overload everything makes me uncomfortable and I wanna rip my skin apart. My clothes my bra my hair, even the fat in my body. I feel ugly and I actually have a huge belly  there's disproportionate amount of fat there and it stresses me out like crazy.  Whenever I feel it I get extremely u comfortable and wanna grab a knife and cut it off. Im Muslim and I can't pray on time. It does not even take that much time but it's fkn tiring. I can't make wuzu (ablution) bc the feeling of getting wet pisses me off. I can't stop scrolling on my phone and no deleting insta isn't an option bc then Im still on my phone doing nothing.

I also have anhedonia so nothing is enjoyable, not even the things I used to find fun and enjoyable. I go to the gym sometimes I can't be consistent . First because of that f*ckass internship and sometimes I don't wake up on time and can't go. I am mentally paralyzed I have executive dysfunction and I can't do anything! I eat compulsively the most unhealthy stuff ever. I feel compelled to eat even if I'm not hungry. I cannot fix my eating habits. I need to lose weight too so this makes me even more stressed. I'm thinking about food all the time to the point that it's fkn tiring. Its bc it produces that quick hit of dopamine. I'm so tired of this lifestyle. 

I'm so damn worried about my future I have so many dreams and ambitions but I can't do anything that'll help me progress towards them. I'm in my last year of uni and I should be more productive. 

And btw I do go to therapy and even take meds. I have a really good psychiatrist so it does help but I'm going thru a horrible phase in life. 2025 has got to be my second worst year. I need to go more frequently. She even said that I should come more frequently and it's fine if I can't pay I can come without paying but I couldn't go a week ago bc of that internship and now she's on a leave for a week or two so it'll take time. I desperately need smth. Im fantasizing abt smth happening to me so I can get attention. 

The sad thing is that I've tried so many medications but sht doesn't work for me. Atp I think they could lobotomize me and it still won't work. I wish they could just euthanize people like me. My doctor is v careful abt the meds she prescribes tho but it just sucks that no trial of meds works for me.

I desperately need help but I'm not sure how anything will help atp. I can't even cry and let it all out but even if I do it won't fix anything. 

I'm sorry for this long post I'm just genuinely losing my mind please I'd appreciate if u read it.

How to cope with the current state of the world?,"Honestly, not much to say here. Unfortunately earth isn't all sunshine and rainbows but this still doesn't make me any less upset. I can barely convince myself to stay alive and being bombarded with bad news left and right makes me feel like there's no point to this. I feel useless for seeing starving  children and innocent people being murdered and going about my day . (Yes, this is about the current wars going on)

And yes, I can limit my screentime, avoid the news for awhile, and do other things but the lingering feeling of existential dread still follows me throughout my day. And not to mention the anxiety, I live in the US and things are definitely getting weird here. Once again I know there will always be shitty,hateful people out there but god its so draining

Adding to the ""existential dread"" part, i'm just exhausted. I feel like I've started to fall into a nihilistic mindset (I believe that's the term? I'm not sure .sorry if that doesn't corelate to what I'm saying.) Ive been trying to engage in my hobbies , connect more with friends and family but I still feel disconnected and dissociated, my depression still lingers no matter what. Only reason why I'm still here is because I don't wanna potentially traumatize the ones around me, but that's also just exhausting. I feel like I should be able to make my own decision, I didn't even ask to be here . I will not go through with it but it's something that still makes me unable to sleep","I feel you. Most of this hits pretty close to home for me. I find life inherently depressing for a lot of reasons, but yeah, the current state of things makes me feel like there truly is no point. For a while, I found nihilistic thoughts somewhat liberating, because even if there’s no point, might as well do something cool with this life. But the world is such a grueling shitshow, and like you, I also live in the US so… yeah. Any kind of good future is seeming progressively further out of reach.

Everyone’s gonna have a different way of coping. I try to stay away from anything detrimental like drinking, that’s only gonna make it worse in the long term. Hobbies are good and you can get lost in them for hours. I love to draw and it’s not expensive at all if you just get basic stuff. I tend to listen to music while doing it too. Creative outlets in general are good, because they divert your attention to the task at hand, and you can get lost in other worlds.

I know a lot of people here including me agree that life is meaningless. But is it our second voice that's deadset on making us feel that way. ,"It's so much easier to be sucked into depression when you're at your lowest low or highest high. When you hit rock bottom, the climb back seems too long and you don't know what the purpose of climbing back up is.

When you achieve what was seemingly the biggest goal of your life, the purpose that motivated you to climb back up is gone. || Isn't the root cause of depression the absence of purpose? You can't feel depressed and purposeful at the same time, can you? || I remember Carl Jung saying that man cannot stand a meaningless life. Maybe he also meant without purpose.

Then I heard from some eastern philosophies say that a purposeless life is the best kind of like. Just purposeless living day by day.

Then I started to question both answers I found like so: is the meaning of life is something we inherit from the culture we were born in?

All I remember is that when I had a purpose in this western culture I was born in, depression felt way lighter. Still had it in me but it didn't show as much as it does now that I know some people in the east can live without (though not many) || I'm from the East and almost all eastern religions circle to the concept of Moksha/Nirvana which is achieved when one loses all sense of self and becomes one with some sort of cosmic power. The main part here is letting go of everything worldly and that includes your identity, desires, aspirations and purpose. || No one knows whether life has an inherent purpose or not, as a result I can never get an answer to the question I originally asked || But when things don't have answers, it means that there is no objectively right answer. Every human will always have an answer to a question, an answer that'll be right for them. Whether or not it's my second voice that makes me feel like life is meaningless is a question that can be answered only when I answer the question: Do I think life has meaning? 

The funny thing here is I don't know what's my first voice and what's second, so I don't know which part of me is answering that question and no matter which part answers the question, the other part won't accept it and as a result I won't feel confident in my answer ever.

I don’t know if I’m depressed,"Hi, I (22f) haven’t been able to explain my feelings lately. I don’t know if I’m depressed or just lost and numb, but I’ve been thinking a lot about life and what I’m even doing with mine. I don’t know where I’m headed. I don’t talk to anyone anymore, I don’t have social media, so I don’t keep up with people, and it’s sort of like I’m completely detached from the world, and listen I have energy at times, but no outlet, because nothing I do feels right or even real.

And honestly, as of recently, I’ve been having thoughts about suicide. I’ve been asking myself, “What if I wasn’t here anymore?” it’s not like I keep up with anyone, I don't have any living family members, or friends. And to be fair I feel like a lot of people have these thoughts, but it freaks me out is how normal they  feel sometimes. To be honest, I want to know what to do, I want these feelings to stop. I hate this feeling of being trapped inside my head. But I don't know what’s causing it, and I don't know where to begin, or go.","does sound like depression to me. feeling numb is a sign of depression, as is detachment and nothing feeling real. and your suicidal thoughts too of course.


I think you should try and calmly think about this, maybe write your thoughts down, to see where all this is coming from.

help with this pit im in,"im 35 male awkward as fuck, haven't been in a relationship since I was 22. I have a good job but I cant seem to get out of my headspace that Ill die alone and unwanted...I've been going back to church just to try and feel some form of connection that just doesn't seem to happen for me...im a broken wreck of a man that is solely existing because I don't want to take my own life, but if something was to happen I don't think at this point that I would try and prevent it. I cant afford drugs to help make myself feel better and have always hated the thought of them anyway. I think that the females that I manage to convince to give me a shot can sense this or something as I never seem to get anything like a 3ed date and right now I just cant see a way out...one of my work colleagues thinks I may have BPD... is this it for me? Am I just going to remain broken forever? cant really speak to a therapist and cant find one that seems right for me. Pleading for some advice on where I can even start as I always seem to self sabotage when I can get started anyway...I dont even know what true happiness feels like anymore (and probably couldn't even recognise it anyway). sorry for the rant and everything but Im just getting my feeling off my chest so feel free to tell me to neck or whatever.

Is it too much to ask for a plate of rice?,"what im feeling:

feeling like a loser, feeling like I've lost in life. I open linkedin and all I see is how are people who were once thrown out of the class for scoring less or the ones who asked me to help them with their assignments are now sorted in life, happy with their IT jobs. Where did I go wrong? I'm sure even they didn't want to take up IT as their career but they did and they are doing it and getting paid 20k-30k and here I am with 5k, and that too this month I wont get that too. I thought December was far but its just 4 months away.

With the amount of leaves ive taken I don't think ill be converted to a full time employee. and neither do I care, why? because this is not what I want to do. what do I want to do? I DONT KNOW. I know every job brings its own level of stress and this is not the type of stress I want or I can handle. I want to do something that comes naturally to me. But what can I do Naturally? drawing? helping? im not an expert in both and neither there is a career associated with both. Tired of being treated as a responsibility, tired of being a burden, tired of not getting what I want and tired of being asked to be grateful with what I have. Let's say, a person is dying of hunger and has a grain of rice; what he wants is a fist full of rice. He's not asking for more, just wants what will satisfy him for now, and with the energy he gets with it, he can do some petty work and then earn and then he can slowly afford for a plateful of rice. But right now, all he has is a grain of rice and he's asked to be grateful for it. Sometimes, something is not better than nothing; something is EQUAL to nothing.

And that's what I have, nothing. A boy loves me and I pity him. I don't see what he sees in me. and that's the point right? If I dont see the capacity in myself, how will I ever be able to do what I like?

Also, what do I like? WHAT is it? I have dreams but they are something I want to happen, not achieve. Getting married to the love of my life, slow mornings with him, treating him with love and care and being treated the same. This is my dream. I do not have any career oriented dream because I never thought of career as the most important thing in life. For me, the only thing that mattered in life is love. Not just in my partner but everywhere in the world. Maybe this is where I went wrong. But such a big punishment for this that I had to change 3 jobs in 1 year along with 5 months of being unemployed? The more I say this, the more disoriented I feel. I cant believe that this is happening to ME. I want to fight this but it is not the right time to give swimming lessons to a person while they are drowning. I just want some time to figure out what I like. I dont think my family will ever understand me for this. Being fed, given shelter, provided education because its their responsibility and not out of love. How can others have right on our time? Why do parents have to show others that they have their children(in my early 20's btw) under their control by yelling and screaming at them in family functions? Why do parents expect their children to use their brains for studies and not for personal decisions?

Is it too much to ask for? Or is it not?

Is it a plateful of rice? Or a grain of rice?

","Yeah I also really really struggle with that. Sadly I have no advice cause Im clueless too.
I feel like school didn't prepare me for what I actually want to do career wise. 
So I tried to draw the decision out by going into higher education but I stopped going to university cause I dont know if I even want to do that.

I am goner,"I am a normal dude who love to play games, work and study with balance. That is why I don't feel depression as often, until recently I never felt so very empty or shiver in my entire life. 

I don't want to get too political, but the cause could be because of... some tensions in area where I live. And our side is weak and will lost for sure. It felt like an inevitable death. I lost the balance that I have; I feel empty when I play games, no will to work, and can't focus on study. Everytime I walk into the room to see my family and friends, we all just try to look happy and calm. It sad for me, but for all of them as well. 

I don't think there is any future for me. I might not live long enough to witness the future of game out there. But maybe sharing it with you guys might make me feel better.

r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!","Is the position still open? || Definitely interested! Is there a specific time limit you have to be on reddit to be able to apply? || I'm interested. I'll send a modmail later in the day when I am free.

The process is taking longer than usual due to some of us having IRL complications, but feel free to apply! || Hey there, we don't have a specific time limit per say, but the longer you've been on Reddit is definitely better!

probably TMI but I clogged a toilet on a cruise ship and now I’m panicking,"Hey guys idek if this was the right place to post this and it kinda sounds stupid and tmi but idk what else to do. 

It's 2 am and im on a cruise ship. i had to poop so bad and i'm really poop shy so once everyone's asleep i finally had the chance to go. 

I flushed and the toilet literally clogged so hard. like the hole where the stuff goes down is so tiny so of course it wouldn’t go down. it started gurgling and my sisters asleep so i kept flushing and praying and it made it worse 

it’s not rising now or anything but I don’t want to call maintenance and wake her up so early so i’m leaving it be but i’m worried it’s going to randomly flood or gurgle again. 

I texted my mom (she’s in another cabin) but she’s asleep and i don’t want to knock on the door and freak her out. My sister has very little tolerance for me and when she wakes up and sees what i did she’s going to be so angry 

I just can’t shut my mind off about it now and I can’t sleep, even though we have such an early day tommorow. every noise and creak i hear makes me  run over to the bathroom to make sure nothings overflowing, and i can’t stop kicking myself for doing this 

","My husband did this like 7 times on a 5 day cruise (big buffet guy) and maintenance was 24/7 and there to help.  They do it all day every day. || it’s going to be fine. toilets don’t just randomly overflow, and if this one does it’s more of the cruiseline’s fault. call maintenance in the morning, laugh about it, it’ll be alright || Maybe wake up 30 minutes before she does and run down to the main desk to request maintenance? Hopefully he can come right before she wakes up and take care of it quickly || I went on a solo cruise in 2022. I was 23 at the time. I clogged my toilet. Called my mom bc I’m just a girl and mortified. Cried and then tried to flush it again all for it to overflow. I called the stewardess & let him know it’s overflowing and it’s clogged, while apologizing profusely of course. 
They see this a lot. I ended up leaving the room for a couple of hours and came back to a fresh bathroom and clean room. But just know I tipped good at the end 🤣🤣 || Let her use the toilet first in the morning and when it doesn't flush, blame it on her.... || As long as it’s not running (making the sound of the water filling the tank after you flush) it won’t overflow. Maybe try to flush it again after an hour? Don’t feel bad though, trust me, this is not the first or last time this has happened! || Just call down and tell them it’s clogged.  Blame it on cruise equipment.  Enjoy your cruise. || Try not to stress about it. You won't be the first or last person to clog a toilet on this cruise. They are used to seeing it, trust me. I'm going to tell you my own cruise ship toilet story to hopefully make you laugh and feel better, and if it doesn't then just ignore it.

I once clogged a toilet on a *brand new* cruise ship by flushing a tampon. My logic was ""well if it can handle giant shits it can take a regular tampon"". No, it could not. 

Not only did it clog the toilet, they had to get a plumber to REPLACE THE PIPES. My cabin steward left a giant pile of feminine products disposal bags. I could feel him silently judging me the rest of the trip. He made sure that I always had a minimum of 50 bags at any given time. It made me feel like that female astronaut when nasa asks her if 100 tampons would be enough, lol. The whole thing became a running joke in my family. 

So, when you find yourself freaking out about potentially clogging the toilet, just think of my experience and laugh. Worst case scenario you might need to ask the steward for a plunger or something, but I highly doubt the pipes will need replaced. Plenty of people are on the ship and I bet a lot of them clog the toilet from time to time. Most likely it will be able to flush in the morning. Just don't flush any tampons. || Commenting to follow this epic story. I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment. || Can you swim? || This actually makes me so sad for you. 

As a sister, me & my sister would be cracking up if either of us did this on vacation. 

Don’t panic!!! It’ll be okay || Lmao sorry 😢 || Also as a sister who has a sister (and we are both highly anxious and both annoy each other sometimes), if she freaks out don’t just take it. It’s not something you did on purpose. It’s just a thing that happened and she can give you shit (haha) or she can act like a reasonable adult and go use your mother’s bathroom while it gets fixed. 

Ah siblings. || Its not a big deal, shit happens. || Put a bit of hand soap/dish soap in the toilet and let it sit for a few minutes then flush. Almost always works. || Just tell someone that the toilet is clogged and tell them to come in the morning to unclog it so it doesn’t take anyone up. Or just ask someone for a plunger and unclog it yourself it’s pretty easy. || It's not your fault anw. It's the maintenance crew's duty to ensure the plumbing system to work normally || Used to work on a cruise ship and I had this issue once. I was nervous also. But maintenance came and fixed it from outside, it was solved in a couple of minutes. Don't worry || put some liquid soap down there, quite a lot, even shampoo.

Anyone ever just wake up anxious sometimes.,The past like 3 days in a row I’ve woken up anxious with like just a bunch of random thoughts running through my mind and then it like continues all morning. Anyone else ever have this? I’m about to take my buspar early lol. What things help in the morning when you have this happen to clear your mind and reset for the day? ,"Yes often! It’s very hard. I workout because it helps me mentally. Not always easy so early in the morning but I do it || yes it's more often than you think.  
The secret is to go to sleep on a clear mind, as much as possible.  
I personally do meditation for 5 minutes, guided meditation and I wake up with a clear mind, but sometimes I don't. || Every single morning, no matter how nice the day before was or how good the sleep was, I wake up freaking out. || Every morning",1753787591.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc8lvz/anyone_ever_just_wake_up_anxious_sometimes/,Anxiety
Woke up forgetting who I was,I woke up forgetting who and where I was. Like I genuinely had no recollection of being alive and I have a huge pit of anxiety in my stomach. It literally feels like I was born today and I don’t remember the rest of my life. Like I don’t remember being alive…. What the hell is this??,"Sounds like DPDR. It happens. You'll be alright. || You are only one it can be a trauma or panic response. Sending calm thoughts your way. || It happens, today I woke up not knowing where I was, who I am, and what time even is (not what time is it).  
I was just looking at alarm ringing and questioning what the hell am I looking at.  
Somehow, I knew how to snooze it for couple of hours and I woke up much better and aware.  
It'll pass just keep your thoughts positive. || I’ve had that happen before. I think it was from when I used to take Xanax though and would fall asleep really hard || I haven’t had this exact situation happen but I have woken up in the middle of the night very confused and disoriented. I don’t know where I am or what’s going on even though I’m in my bed at home and have been living here for years. This doesn’t happen often but I think it’s a trigger based on whatever I’ve gone through recently and if there was a high stress event. Having a slower bedtime routine, no sounds or music, less screen time, no dramatic reading or watching. I seem to sleep better especially if I got a workout in and tire myself out. Hope this helps. || Thank you! || sure thing.

Anyone else gaining more fear as you age?,"I’ve been noticing this extra anxiety within the last year. And it could be be because I’m a new mom so the world looks much scarier now. But I think I’ve slick always been this way. Very cautious and observant. When you’re young, you really think it couldn’t happen to you. It can and that’s all the proof I need. I know it can and I won’t be pushing it. 

But as I get older i think of every scenario of danger anytime. Even at home. I can not do crowds. Barely can do shopping. Any place that I can’t immediately leave from feels so scary. I walk into a store and immediately think okay what would happen if someone started shooting. Everyone would run. What if they ran over me. What if we all piled up at the doors and couldn’t get out in time. 

Today we went to a new store near us. Specifically went at night on a Monday to avoid crowds. And I felt like every person we passed was staring us down. Felt like a threat. Like I didn’t want to turn my back on them. 

I hate this feeling. It feels like I’m constantly a prey or in danger. Anyone else? And for the record I take lexapro and Wellbutrin for anxiety and adhd. So maybe I need to up that shit idk ","The anxiety I experience in vehicles has gotten worse for me. I have a hard time in the car, in the boat. Sometimes I struggle if I’m driving but ifs even worse when someone else has the control. || the older you get the more you realize how fragile everything is. especially once you’ve got someone to protect. your brain just starts running worst case scenarios like it’s prepping for battle. it doesn’t mean you’re broken. it probably means you’re way more aware than you used to be. || You start realizing how fragile human life is. When you have kids, you realize that you still being alive is a bit of a miracle. 

When you are younger, you don't even realize that your perception of the world is not reality, but just a perception. You think you know what will happen and why things happen. With time you realize that everything is an illusion and your perception is just that - a perception based on things you have seen and experienced, a limited interpretation of the world. And that most times you don't really know why something happened and what will happen || I relate so much. It is like awareness turns into hyper vigilance the older I get. || Yeah its one of the reasons i quit smoking and vaping. Like the anxiety over catching something permanent is a lot more real now at 30 than when i was freshly 20 years old || Yeah we really are fragile",1753770986.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc48w2/anyone_else_gaining_more_fear_as_you_age/,Anxiety
Is anyone else constantly guessing if it’s anxiety or something actually wrong?,"I feel like every little symptom like chest tightness, tingling, random dizziness just sends me down a spiral. Half the time I convince myself it’s anxiety but there’s always that what if this time it’s not? voice in the back of my head. I’ve been trying not to immediately Google everything (because that never helps as we all know lol) and I’ve started journaling a bit, doing breathing stuff and even tried this AI doctor app from Eureka health just to see if it could give a second opinion which actually felt pretty accurate and personal but yeah it’s still exhausting.

Just wondering if anyone else deals with this constant guessing game? What’s worked for you to not feel like you’re losing your mind over every weird sensation? Any tips or insight is highly appreciated thanks.","this is one of my biggest struggles and pretty much feels the exact way you described it. don’t worry it’s common to hyperfixate on one symptom. the best you can do is just distract yourself with something like journaling/going on a walk/watching a movie, or even just reminding yourself that you’re okay. we got this💗 || I do this.. I have a select few things I'm scared of and I can convince myself any body symptoms or minor illness is proof I have these conditions. I could probably convince my self that my hair growing is a sign of heart disease. 

It's exhausting. I get over one thing then straight on to another and around in circles we go. || I have the same thing. And honestly, reddit did help. Seeing how many people had the same thing made me realize that maybe it is all in my head after all. So I reccommend definetely continue writing and reading here. Other than that, I unfortunately don't have an answer yet either. || I have severe anxiety and can be a hypochondriac sometimes but that all comes from like a million actual health struggles. Been seeing different specialists since I was a kid and for some symptoms they still can’t tell me the cause. I feel like I’m going crazy and can’t tell apart what’s real and what isn’t. But no matter how accepting I am of the situation it still keeps me from living my life. I have chronic pain in my lower back or kidneys and get cramps so bad I get paralysed for like 10 minutes. It gives me so much anxiety because it comes out of nowhere and it’s just a messed up circle of catastrophizing. || I'm constantly convincing myself I have every single mental health condition in the world. I think it's pretty normal for people with anxiety to hyper fixate on new symptoms and try to figure out why you feel that way. I think the fact that I'm neurodivergent also makes it worse cause I want to understand everything about myself but I'm constantly evolving into a new person so it just puts me in an existential spiral every few months of me feeling like I don't know who I am. || Yes! And I’ve had the same scary symptoms for 10 years. I’ve gone to the ER more times that I can recall (sometimes more than once a month for a few months in a row), I’ve seen multiple cardiologists,I monitor my pulse/BP at home….i try to remind myself that I’ve felt these feelings so many times and I’ve always been fine. Also I have an Ativan RX and anytime I take it, I feel fine within an hour, which proves it’s anxiety. Yet I still think I’m experience a heart problem or a stroke etc on a weekly basis.  

Something that helped me was seeing cardiologists and getting testing done instead of going to the ER so often. That helps me logically tell myself I’m a healthy 29 year old and who doesn’t have a heart condition and my extensive testing shows it. 

Sometimes when I can’t sleep it helps me to read people’s posts on Reddit. seeing how many people experience the exact same symptoms and have been okay helps reassure me. I’ve also told chat gpt and my vitals a few times in these scenarios and it’s really helped me feel reassured especially when I’m awake alone all night. 

Also i find that putting my sound canceling headphones on and listening to calming frequencies, podcasts, or guided meditation helps me block out my own thoughts. 

I have always struggled with GAD and panic attacks, but the last couple years health anxiety is my biggest problem.  I hope you find some peace from this soon! || My first clue that I have health anxiety issues is when I realized that I would be hyper fixated on one symptom at all times. I would recover/forget about one thing and suddenly there was a new symptom to think about for awhile. At some point I figured that probably wasn’t a normal thing to always have a symptom/condition to be worrying about 🤣 || Do not google. It always tells you worse case scenario.. but I've been struggling with this for the last 7-8 years..  When im dealing with my anxiety problems, I have these same problems too but like you said I have the voice in the back of my mind, then I fixate on my issues and I panic. || and i have adhd as well so you know im hyperfixated on those thoughts until i feel like i don’t know if im actually feeling it or scaring myself || I have terrible health anxiety. Every single little feeling makes me think something is wrong. I hyper fixate on it and it ruins my day. I’m always thinking “do I need to go to the ER?” and i’m always scared. || Yep, on the same boat.
I have struggled with anxiety and depression for many years, and only now have I started to get physical symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and gastrointestinal issues. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious, I feel very nauseous like I am going to vomit but can't vomit, and also I am having a lot of tension headaches that stem from my neck and shoulders. It radiates towards my head, and the pain is unbearable, doesn't get better with normal painkillers. || Totally feel this, it’s like living in a constant game of “anxiety or illness?” and it’s exhausting. What’s helped me a bit is tracking patterns and reminding myself that anxiety symptoms feel real, even if the cause isn’t dangerous. || I’ve dealt with this as long as I can remember. I don’t know if this is great advice, but I try to take some deep breaths and distract myself because I assume if I’m actually not OK then the ailment wouldn’t just disappear. 99% of the time once I’ve taken some good breaths and I’m distracted (wrapped up in a video game, a book, cooking, cleaning, etc.) I stop feeling dizzy or tingly or whatever. That’s how I know it’s just anxiety. If it doesn’t go away then I drink some water and have a snack, or maybe even a nap if it’s possible at the moment. || Totally get this. The “what if it’s not just anxiety” thought is relentless. Breathing exercises and writing things down help me a lot too. It’s tough, but you're doing your best, and that matter || Yes, I have the same sentiments. It's like a never-ending conflict between ""it's just anxiety"" and ""what if this time it's something serious?"" Dizziness, tightness in my chest, and strange feelings often make me uneasy.  
  
Writing things down, avoiding Google, and performing basic breathing or grounding techniques are what I find to be somewhat helpful. Knowing that you are not alone in feeling thus helps a lot on difficult days.  
  
Without a doubt, you are not alone. || Oh yeah. As of late I've been mildly obsessing over the possibility of having ALS. But I'm 17 almost 18, don't usually get sick too bad, and no one in my family's had it that I'm aware of. And I think it might be so bad that I'm almost convincing myself that I'm showing symptoms, because so far there's nothing I haven't been able to do, I'm even able to write with my left hand a bit as a righty. I dropped the pencil turning it around one time and ruined my day though. It mostly started because I got these twitches in my muscles, mainly in my legs and biceps. And now I keep feeling like ""what if I'm weak that means I'll die"" and stuff like that. But it helps to remind myself that not long ago I was worried I had breast cancer and it was nothing, and that I was worried I had meningitis with one headache. Also nothing. I mean, given how my hands are actively shaking I'm not totally sure it's working, but I'm trying and it helps when I consciously think about it. || Yes I get the same way too. Definitely puts me at ease to hear a lot of other people feel the same because I genuinely always think there’s something really wrong with me. I once went to the ER because I was convinced I was having a heart attack, I could feel the heaviness on my chest, everything came back fine and they told me it was probably a panic attack. || It really is about finding little ways to ground yourself when your brain’s running wild. journaling + walks have been surprisingly helpful for me too. appreciate you sharing, makes me feel less alone in it. || Any slight chest pain or arm pain and I’m convinced a heart attack is happening.  I’ve been to the ER for it 4 times in 15 months, with no signs of a cardiac event.  Have you found any way to deal with it, aside from meds? || Ugh yes, that “one thing to the next” loop is so real. it’s like as soon as you calm down about one symptom your brain’s already searching for the next threat.",1753720951.0,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbl9tt/is_anyone_else_constantly_guessing_if_its_anxiety/,Anxiety
"Stuck in severe panic attack mode, body feels like it’s shutting down",I’m so desperate for relief - my body is literally stuck in a state of panic and I’m in severe pain. I can’t function like this anymore. My heart is racing and I can’t get any rest. I feel like my world is crashing down. I’m so desperate for help. Has anyone else survived this before? I’ve done everything I can to prevent going to the hospital but I’m at the end of the road,"I’ve survived it many times and every time! You will too.

List of things I do when it’s really bad:
- ice pack on chest,  back of neck, or forehead
- calming essential oils on my wrists or a tissue and sniff it
- lofi or jazz instrumental music
- asmr videos on youtube
- happy color phone app
- hug a stuffed animal or my cat and/or asked a loved one to hug me
- hum or sing a happy song to myself (activates vagus nerve)
- tapping I learned in therapy (google the sequence, even tapping just one of those areas can help)
- slow intentional breathing in thru nose out thru mouth, longer on the exhale
- give my body a little shake or do a tense-and-release exercise (tense muscle for a few seconds, then release, moving area by area from top to bottom face, shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs, toes)
- count backwards from 100 in sets of 3 (requires some concentration and takes mind off spiraling thoughts)
- suck on a sour or gingery candy
- fidget rings or a pony tie/rubber band on wrist and snap it repeatedly (not too hard though, don’t injure yourself)
- force myself to smile or laugh (it’s weird but I find it automatically makes me feel better)
- repeatedly think of positive comments to myself even if it’s silly. Like “I’m a pretty princess, I’m a bad bitch, I can handle this and anything”


I do a combination of a few of the above at a time, not all of them. In different moments I feel like I need different things. Some of them work better sometimes than other times. I hope something here helps. || If you have access to ice cubes, put some in a big bowl of water. Put your face into the water and blow out slowly. It will help transition your nervous system out of the fight/flight state. || I was in this state *a lot* a few years back. Remember being afraid I was dying or that my mind or body wouldn't be able to sustain it. But they did.

Find a TV show. A chill one, maybe one you liked as a kid. The Nanny, Hey Arnold, Frasier, Father Ted, The IT Crowd, Mythbusters and How It's Made were some of my big ones. These were some of the only things that would reset my system enough to sleep. || Ice on chest is suppose to stimulate vagus nerve and calm you. You could try it while box breathing...maybe it will help. || I can only say it will pass. I've been there this week and thankfully it has passed ❤️ || I think if you really feel like you need the hospital you should go. Theres no shame in needing help. || State of tension my arms hurt. || I have been there. I went to the hospital and it made me feel better to understand it was all just anxiety. Do what you need to do. || Been there and still kind of struggling. It’s gotten better but if you feel the need to go, do what you gotta do! No shame on that  || Just went through that yesterday. It will pass. Keep reminding yourself it will pass, as horrible as it feels right now. It will pass, look forward to that. || Everything everyone else said but also this is stupid but get yourself a harmonica. When you’re panicking and you’re breathing heavily, start breathing into the harmonica. I did that once during a panic attack and it was so stupidly hilarious that it reset my brain. It worked many times after. Also try downloading some very simple memory games, like the flash card type. Very simple logic puzzles pull me right out of it. 
But also, going to the hospital is not the end of the world. They can help you with a panic attack, I went several times for panic attacks in the past. They gave me a nice little anti anxiety cocktail and set me up with a therapist. || I am stuck in fight or flight mode for such a long time that I don't know how I can even relax and feel calm. Always on edge has made my nerves so excited that I get scared or jumpy even with smallest of things like things moving in my peripheral vision, someone touching without me anticipating it. I even get scared of my own shadow sometimes because it feels like something is moving in my peripheral vision. || Do you call going to the hospital at the end of the road? Hey, this hasn’t happened to you in just 1 day and won’t pass in 1 day. Patience.

And, see a doctor (psychiatrist). Earlier you visit, earlier you get recovery. 

I wasn’t even able to eat and lost 8 kilograms in a couple of months. Regaining weight again. This recovery took 3 months. This changes for everyone individually but you should seek professional help from a doctor.

All will be good, all will pass, trust me. || Yes to all of these!! There are really good recommendations in this thread that have helped a lot of us get through what you’re experiencing. 

Op, I’ve dealt with panic attacks like this for 10 years and I feel for you. I used to go to the ER once or twice a month for years and it was always anxiety. I’ve always lived within 10-20 min from an ER, and a few times I realized if I just went to the parking lot or somewhere near by and chilled in my car I’d start to feel better. After I did that a few times i stopped going to the ER because I knew my symptoms were from my anxiety and they’d calm down once i felt safe being near the ER. 

Another thing that helps calm my mind and distract me is reading other peoples Reddit threads about feeling the same way. That might freak some people out but for me, it helps me logically know that it’s a common experience and people survive it. 

If possible, you should talk to a dr about addressing your anxiety. There are also a lot of online resources for exploring options as well. 

I hope you feel better soon! Do your best to at least eat small meals and drink water. It’s crazy how much worse you can feel if you don’t eat/hydrate for a day or two. You’ll get through this! || This is amazing. I took a screenshot for myself. Thank you  🥹🧡 || Or take a cold shower and put your face into the water. Helps me every time || This message gives me hope. I am so scared that I can’t make it or that i’m gonna go crazy and lose it. I’m so scared. || I second this. A little Ativan or Xanax can slow things down.

I feel fortunate I have a psychiatrist who gives me a few Klonopin each month for times like this. || This is SO REAL. I live 2 miles from an ER and there’s an EMS Fire Station literally across the street and I STILL panic thinking “what if I need them? what if they’re not available? what if i can’t get to the ER fast enough?” it’s so draining. everywhere I go i hyper focus on how far the closest ER is. || 💓",1753741878.0,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbuirb/stuck_in_severe_panic_attack_mode_body_feels_like/,Anxiety

Did you know anxiety actually comes with some surprising benefits?,"I used to think my anxiety made me weak… until I came across some wild research that flipped that narrative.

A study using a real-life “shoot/don’t shoot” simulation showed that people with high anxiety:

* Were more accurate at distinguishing between threats and innocents
* Had better shooting precision than those without anxiety (Yeah… anxiety turning us into warriors wasn’t on my bingo card either.)

Another study found that anxious people tend to handle crises better, they're more alert, responsive, and come out safer than laid-back folks in high-stakes situations.

One even suggested that adolescents with anxiety are more likely to survive past 25 than those without it. Something about heightened awareness and cautious decision-making.

And get this: according to Harvard’s Cass Sunstein, anxious leaders:

* Are more flexible
* Better at active listening
* And come up with creative solutions under pressure

So if you’ve been feeling broken or less-than because of your anxiety, I hope this gives you a new lens.  
It’s not just a curse.  
Sometimes, it’s your superpower, misunderstood, but real.

Can’t go back to school,"I’m so worried and stressed about going to school I can’t think about school without crying. When I’m in school I start throwing up or having stomachaches and then I hide in the toilet and don’t want to come out. During lessons my heartbeats so fast and I’m so stressed and anxious. I’ve been using my vomiting and stomachaches to go to the doctor and miss school but I can’t keep doing this anymore. I’m so behind and it’s making my worries worse. 

Though I don’t have friends in school, my teachers and people are generally nice to me. But I missed a lot of school before this due to an actual sickness and I’m already super behind and now it’s scary to come back. I can’t stand coming to class I’m so scared what do I do? I’m seeing the school counsellor already and she explained avoidance is going to make my anxiety worse and stuff but it’s too difficult right now idk what to do :( Please help","I went through the same exact thing like 4 years ago when i was in high school. Your counselor is right, avoidance will in fact make things worse, i was told this as well. I learned it’s best to take things one step and one day at a time. I literally just had to go to school no matter how awful I felt. I would have to take several breaks and go to the bathroom to do deep breathing, it helped sometimes until eventually it started helping most of the time. Whatever negative feelings and thoughts you have no matter how severe, just let them wash over you. Let your heart race, let your stomach turn and just continue to remind yourself that you’re okay. If you have any hobbies that your really like try focusing on those things too, give yourself things to look forward to each day. || I highly recommend visiting a medical professional regarding this. It definitely seems like you need to be on medication and go to therapy. You can’t just not go to school. || Your counselor is correct. The only way to stop anxiety is to confront it directly. There are medicines and therapy that can help, but all those do is make it a bit easier for you to confront your anxiety.

How do I stop feeling emotionally disconnected?,"Idk if this is the right place to post, I started taking sertraline ( 25mg for 2 weeks ) for my anxiety and for like 10 days I felt like an absolute zombie, now I feel better, I’m able to do things for myself in life and I feel real, but I feel so emotionally detached from people

I was hanging out with a friend and we were having fun but I just couldn’t get myself to really laugh. I can’t laugh at things I usually did like TV shows and reels. I can’t get myself to feel anything when I listen to my favourite songs. I know I love my friends but it just feels like a distant fact, I don’t actually feel it most of the time nowadays

There is this girl I really like but I barely feel anything now. She’s literally the best and she’s one of the very few people I talk to right now and she made me really laugh a few times this week which was rare for me. But I feel horrible and I feel like a fake person, I mean I feel like that with my friends too but friendships are a lot more low maintenance than relationships so i don’t overthink about that too much. I don’t miss her or anyone much anymore and I don’t feel like doing any typical romantic things all of a sudden- I feel nothing. How am I supposed to figure out my feelings when I feel numb and distant? 

I first started feeling a bit of numbness before medication when I was really anxious about the girl. My brain used to overthink about everything, and Im the type to disconnect instinctively when I think I’ll get hurt. But this time it’s the nicest girl ever, I want things to workout with her but idk how if I’m all disconnected. I told her I feel numb and she still doesn’t care but I don’t want to hurt her in any way. I’d normally be the type to obsess over someone for 2 weeks and then get disgusted by their flaws but I really like this girl, I just don’t feel it rn but I really want it to work. It’s worse when people say stuff like ‘if it’s the right person you won’t need to think of all this’ cause I feel nothing 

Sometimes I do feel emotions but they’re always just anxiousness or sadness and nothing happy, I broke my Apple Watch yesterday and actually felt bad about it for a second. 

Is there any way I can stop feeling like this? I used to hate being connected to people but I’ve realised that just means I experience no real happiness, I want to feel now.

"ADHD—I'm on a path to disaster, and see no way forward","
I was recently diagnosed ADHD-PI, and with that came a violent shift in perspective on my life. And it's not pretty.

I realized I've opted out of everything difficult my whole life—Got a useless art degree, gave up on a driver's license and worked retail jobs.

Even on slower days, there was nothing left of me after a shift (probably in large part because of social masking, and going into mental overdrive to not make mistakes). It was soul crushing, and from day one I desperately looked for a way out.

When my workplace shut down, I took my chance, and with some luck I've managed to live off investing for the last 5 years. The freedom was irresistible, and the alternative unthinkable. I was happy.

With the diagnosis, my naive bubble finally popped: I can't keep this up forever. I'll have to get a job. The gap in my resume is a chasm. And while I'm not proud to say it, the idea of giving up my freedom, forever this time, fills me with dread. How the hell can I ever be happy again, knowing I'll never have what I had? And perhaps worse, I no longer want anything, other than to stay with my girl.

There's also my relationship. We've been together, very happily, for over a decade, and I'm realizing I'm nowhere near ready or capable of being a parent, deal with home ownership, and many other parts of adult life. I can barely keep from being overwhelmed as it is. The thought of losing her to my ADHD is alone enough to paralyze me with fear. She's the one.

This has all come down on me so hard and fast I'm soaked in anxiety and stress every day, and this has wrecked my sleep. I manage one or two hours before I'm wide awake again. With unsustainable sleep medication I manage 4-5h, but the cortisol rise at 4am rouses me awake, and at 8am it's enough to make me spasm with anxiety. This has in turn made all my ADHD symptoms so much worse; I can't pay attention, learn or make a decision for the life of me anymore. I can barely see through the brain fog. This of course further feeds the stress and anxiety. Adding in ADHD medication at this point is likely to further mess with my already ruined sleep.

And since I can't help but catastrophize, it seems all but inevitable that my sleep issues, stress, anxiety and the exacerbated ADHD would be even worse and immediately trip up any work opportunities I might miraculously get.

With all this, I am truly despairing. I don't know how to move forward, how to feel safe enough to sleep again, or if there's even a path back to happiness. Disaster is around the corner, and I fear the absolute worst. I'm genuinely scared.

Any help or perspective is appreciated.","you have to calm down, think and find solutions of your problem",1753797558.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mcc6uy/adhdim_on_a_path_to_disaster_and_see_no_way/,Anxiety
"Struggling,","So since about yesterday morning I’ve had really tight chest/nausea feelings. I know that it’s probably just my anxiety, but I don’t know why it’s about. I have super bad health anxiety as well as general anxiety and so I’m both scared I’m dying of some sort of heart or lung issue and trying to calm down whatever I was anxious about in the first place, if that makes sense. I’m going on a trip to a concert tomorrow so I wonder if maybe that’s it, but I’m really not sure. Any tips or advice on how to stop feeling like I’m going to die would be so greatly appreciated!!!

How to manage this feeling.,"I'm laying in bed trying to wind down for sleep and I just have this swirling anxiety in the pit of my stomach. It feels soo bad. It's come up to my chest too and just hovers all over that area.

It's more extreme than my usual day to day anxiety.

What do you do to manage this? I did box breathing earlier and that only helped so much..","meditate, hum/sing to yourself, count backwards from 500, these might not be helpful but it’s what i do when i’m in a similar situation || Watch Tim Box on youtube hes essentially cured my chronic anxiety.

Starting to think how I feel every day isn’t actually normal?,"For as long as I can remember — even as a kid — I’ve felt wired and tense most of the day. Shallow breathing, mentally drained after work, overstimulated in group settings (though one-on-one feels fine). I usually come home just needing quiet and feel anxious or disconnected, while others seem totally fine doing the same job. I’m (23 years old atm)

Some days are a bit better, but most days I’m running on edge, and I’m starting to realize maybe that’s not normal.

I sleep 7–8 hours a night, get 8–10k steps daily, just started going to the gym, and work a regular 8-hour, 5-day week. So I should feel okay — but I don’t.

I’ve been taking magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and L-theanine, but they haven’t helped. If anything, I sometimes feel worse.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of low-level, constant stress or tension even when life should feel manageable? What helped you actually feel better in your body?","Oh wow I could have wrote this post when I was 23.

Here is some advice, you can do what you want with it, Ill start with the things that are going to be hard.

-You are going to find certain things stressful that others do not. Your anxiety baseline is much higher than someone who does not have this disorder. When something does go off that IS stressful, its going to shoot your stress levels to misery.

Based on this, you need to find a career that is less rat racey than most. You are going to have to find a partner that doesn't stress you out on the daily. You will (I did, took a while).

Identify the things in life that make that pit in your stomach move up your body and work to either address them or minimize them.

Medications may work for a while, you may go through periods where you even feel almost ""normal"", but in my experience our bodies constantly seek our normal baseline. Medications don't ""fix"" this, they merely mask it.

The things you can do yourself: Meditation. Especially vagus nerve stimulation. Try this every day for a week or so. Loads of guided ones on youtube. It has an accumlative effect on me, and I can tell when I havent done any in a while.

Watch out for the booze. That was my crutch for years.

I could go on and on but I have to go have a meditation and shower lol.

What's the most oddly specific thing that triggers your anxiety that you can't explain to others?,"Mine is when apps crash or freeze while I'm using them. Not just mild annoyance like actual panic level anxiety. Like when netflix starts buffering or my phone lags during a game I get this immediate fight or flight response that's completely disproportionate to the situation. I think it's because entertainment apps have become my go to coping mechanism for stress so when they malfunction it feels like losing my safety net. But try explaining to someone that your phone freezing gives you the same anxiety as being trapped in an elevator and they look at you like you're insane. Also weirdly triggered by notification sounds when I'm not expecting them. My own phone notifications are fine but hearing someone else's text alert in a quiet room makes my heart race. It's like my brain interprets random notification sounds as some kind of emergency even when they're not mine. The worst is when I'm watching something and get the ""weak connection"" message. Instant anxiety spiral about being disconnected from everything. Which is ridiculous because humans survived for thousands of years without this but here we are. What about you guys?

Can (medical) anxiety cause 24/7 dizziness/lightheadedness?,"Ever since 2 days after a health scare, I have been dizzy and lightheaded every single day, from the second I wake up until bedtime. It seems to get worse in the evening after work, once I’m home. Could this be because of medical anxiety?","I had a vertigo attack January of 2025 and have been dizzy since. And developed severe panic attacks. So I would say so. I’m off balance all day then get these sudden rushes of intense collapsing feeling. You’re not alone. I feel so isolated. Nobody understands unless they go through it || My biggest symptom of anxiety/ after panic attacks was being dizzy/ lightheaded/ feeling like i was going to pass out. All because one day I thought I was going to pass out….. it caused a whole anxiety spiral. I start cbt on Wednesday and I highly recommend looking into that and how to rewire to brain to get out of the anxious cycle. Thinking about it 1000000% made it worse for me. || This is one of my main symptoms especially when I’m worked up/super anxious about something but not in a panic attack type of way. Like if I’m stressing over something that I won’t have an immediate answer for - health issues being one of them. || I can literally relate. I just started having intense lightheadedness yesterday and have been experiencing it today too. I’ve been dealing with “health scare” for 3 weeks now and had other anxiety symptoms. You’re definitely not alone and been trying to look for relief.  || Anxiety affects your heart rate and blood pressure as well which also causes your symptoms... I'd pay attention to those || i was dizzy & lightheaded every day with different severities but i could still function, drive, etc. i also had extreme health anxiety, & panic attacks. it wasn’t until i started lexapro all those went away. very grateful || You can look into PPPD or other suggestions on here but I had it bad for three months and to be honest coming here on Reddit made it worse. No one can answer why? Or what it is? So here is my advice, stop focusing on it. Try to live your life day by day. If you feel dizzy or get weird drop feelings focus on something else.  I had dizziness, feeling of being pushed, unsteady legs, and weird heads spins (zaps). I forced myself to walk the dog and do simple exercises like light weights. What happens is your brain gets use to feeling like this and creates patterns. You need to rewire your brain. Baby steps but trust me it will go away. If it gets worse after work is because work keeps you busy. Your mind is busy. At home, you think more. Good luck
Edit: forgot i got the dizziness after a traumatic event in my life. || yes! i just kind of use to it. Atleast you are still able to do your regular job. || This happens to me whenever I get in a health anxiety episode. || Yuuuuppp! 100% I have the same crap going on right now... I went to my ENT today to get checked out just in case and she did the eply maneuver on me which seemed to provide some relief. Also she told me I had issues with my allergies and prescribed me some nasal spray and some nasal rinse, on top of that I have TMJ soooo that doesn't really help either which I'm pretty sure alot of us might have that or atleast grind our teeth? But yes, I started having the dizzy fun times I think 6-8moths ago and some days it's okay somedays I can't do much or else it will just make it worse. || Anxiety does what it wants! Seriously it will make you feel everything! || If you look at this sub, anxiety has the widest range of weird symptoms, none of which are seriously dangerous just scary at first, like heart palpitations, panic attacks, fainting, vomiting etc.

anxious people are prone to hypochondria and convincing themselves theyre either dying, have cancer or something is wrong with them medically even despite the evidence that everything is fine physically. i hate to say its all in your head, but anxiety can produce insane intense physical symptoms that mimic other problems like vomiting, GERD, blood pressure, asthma attack, twitching and such.

i can say that 99.9% of panic attacks were not deadly for those in this sub. It just felt like it was at the time, because part of your mind is convinced its dying when its not. so at the moment its impossible to override this instinctual subconscious fear. the years of panic attacks is literal proof that ones mind is not reliable at finding actual threat and has extreme failure rate, right? so why would one trust their gut when its wrong all the time and misses threats when they actually exist, and people people fine the most right before or during serious threat. when i am the most scared, i am the most physically healthy by every test imaginable.

this paradox is annoying. Even if there was something wrong, your mind wouldnt accurately find it and definitely not this way. panic attacks and such come on suddenly and often fade away suddenly, indicating psychological response. actual threats often are progressive and gradual or cyclical, not so sudden and short and random || Very similar here to, for me i try keep busy, distraction is my biggest coping mechanism albeit exhausting st times || might also be acid reflux or allergies || Yep, really common symptom, suffered from it more times than I can count. || I've had a bout of TMJ lately, grinding teeth in sleep, stuffed ears, vertigo, sneezing, dry eye syndrome, it goes on and on...I am very anxious, I am on cardiac meds and with this rainy, hot humid weather it's worse....I barely can do any gardening....I'm done venting.... || This happened to me too back in 2022 and I haven’t been the same since. Dizzy 24/7. || Also something similar happened to me last summer and it ended up being vestibular migraines! || Same with me. 20 years ago.

"Severe ocd causing depression, scared to fix anything anymore.","I’m going through something terrible, I had a massive nervous breakdown a little over two months ago, since then I’ve been in what feels like hell mentally. I’m extremely unstable , some days feel like things might be making a turn around.. then out of nowhere the next day is terrible. I spent weeks in a constant panicked state to the point where I was driving to the hospital trying to go in but just kept turning around and going home because it made it worse. 

I have severe social anxiety to the point where I’ve isolated myself away from everyone except my girlfriend who lives with me and my family who lives right beside me. I still talk to my friends on the phone somedays , but I can’t manage to want them to come around me because of my instability & the fact that I can’t go to them right now. I rarely am able to leave the house because I start panicking on the road and come home immediately. I started therapy with an OCD specialist a month and a half ago and quit because the video calls were causing extreme anxiety for me & I couldn’t tolerate it at the time. She suggested medication, which of course I’m scared of too. 

As a result of this my sleep schedule is extremely backwards right now, going to bed at 8-10am and waking up at 5-6pm. It’s miserable, I have so much ocd centered around sleep that it’s hard to mess with this because when I do It flares me up worse.

On top of this all of this recent flaring and changes has made me extremely depressed. I feel subhuman because of my inability to move toward anything positive in my life. I feel like I develop a new fear every single day.. I don’t know what to do or how to do it right. 

I seriously have no life, I wake up and sit around the house all day trying to find something “fun” to do.. trying to do positive things for my body and health and this is all I can think about. I truly feel like nothing I do is enough, and it’s all by force to try and “get better”


Where do I start , I’m so lost ","I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Start small, try improving sleep gradually, consider getting back to therapy, and be open to medication if it feels right. Progress takes time, but you're not alone. Take it one step at a time || Hello, I used to have quite extreme OCD, too. Also GAD and depression. And medication gave me my life back. I really recommend trying it. I understand you're scared of it, but keep in mind how you can quit taking it if anything. Especially during the first few weeks you can quit cold turkey. So there isn't much of a risk in trying it. || I’m really sorry you’re struggling. Start with tiny steps, like a small daily routine or stepping outside briefly. Talk to your therapist about what feels manageable, maybe try in-person sessions if video calls are too hard. Lean on your girlfriend and family for support. Healing takes time, so be gentle with yourself. You’re not alone || It just feels like I have no control over my body. Everyday is different either things feel more calm & that’s scary.. or they feel worse & that’s even scarier. I just feel like everything I’m doing is hurting me in someway shape or form. I’m so tired of it I feel so sick with no way out of whatever is going on. Just thinking about what’s going on for too long is enough to send me into a spiral of pain


I’m trying though, i walk/ run a little daily.. which is hard for me. If I need to do something and my brain says no, I do it anyways. Like shower, brush my teeth, do my laundry. It just doesn’t feel like it’s making an impact right now, and I hate it. I want something to change for the better for once

Thank you for your kindness || I really want to take it, I know it’s probably a huge step in the right direction deep down. I just know how I latch to things, I have a fear I’ll take the medicine and be thrown into a spiral where all I do is panic about having taken the medication to the point where I think the meds is what’s causing the attacks.. it’s an awful mindset I know, but it’s a huge part of my problem

I’m at the point though where I almost am willing to suffer through whatever it is in hopes that one day it’ll make a difference but I just don’t know how much more I can take || I get it.

Got a letter from the IRS with a bill I can’t afford and feel like the world is falling apart around me.,"I (26M) received one those stimulus refund checks that a lot of people received back in December. Well it turns it there was a mistake and I wasn’t supposed to receive it. I also made a mistake and mixed up the dates thinking it was the for the first stimulus check that I didn’t receive so I had cashed it. Now they want the full $1400 back, most likely with interest and I can’t afford it so I took out a loan to repay it immediately with a money order. I understand these things happen and I’ve done everything I can to right the situation.

Now I’m in a deep spiral of “what if’s”. I keep thinking “what if the loan doesn’t go into my account on time? What if it gets lost in the mail and I lose $1400 that I still have to pay back? What if they don’t receive it on time and I get penalized?” It’s just nonstop since last night. I haven’t gotten any sleep because my brain won’t turn off. I can hardly breathe and I keep panicking.

I also take Propranolol, Mirtazapine (for sleep), and Olanzapine, and none of those really help the anxiety during the daytime. (The Mirtazapine does help at night.)

And it's getting harder and harder for me to get enough sleep, since I dread the coming day so much.

Pretty crap situation. || i feel stuck on paxil too. i’m on 60mg and i’m so scared of withdrawals. || Oh my gosh that is high to start. Did you have side effects upon starting it or did it always just instantly helped they have me on .25 twice a day as needed the first time I tried it. I thought it worked great and even helped my lightheaded and everything today I tried it and I just feel really aww and tired so it may be dependent on what I have going on when I take it or maybe it’s from trying weed yesterday which I never do and hopefully that’s all it is and will work better again for me soon, but I’m trying to use it sparingly. Been trying to decide between that and Ativan . It’s super hard.
I’m so sorry what are your withdrawals they won’t give you anything to help with that not even if you get a prescription that’s crazy to me but welcome to the system .. I hope you do ok off it || Yes there were actually massive side effects when I would be at work and sitting down I would notice myself falling asleep straight up nodding out this lasted for a few months but I never said anything because it worked so well. This is pretty poor advice but I'm actually glad that I never said anything because the dosage ended up working out just fine in the long run. After a few months it never even made me tired anymore. I know people that can barely walk taking 1 mg and it kind of makes me chuckle because I can take 4 mg at once and not get sleepy. I'm actually astonished the effectiveness is still almost 100% just like it was a decade ago.

Taking one right when I wake up and another at about 5:00 p.m. seems to have worked the best for me all this time if that's worth anything.

I also have experience with Ativan if my anxiety is really bad taking it twice a day is effective but I still feel it. Personally if you have constant anxiety all day such as it feels like it's part of you even if you don't think of anxiety inducing things and you still have anxiety that's exactly how I feel and clonazepam would be the best choice because its so long lasting, at least for me I can't tell you its the best for you as your body may be different I'm just suggesting that clonazepam is a little more effective than Ativan.

Anytime that I may thank my clonazepam doesn't work anymore all I have to do is stop taking it and let me tell you feeling like you can't breathe will remind you all over again that it's still working.",1753740741.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbu2c4/anyone_else_absolutely_exhausted_by_their_anxiety/,Anxiety

My brother is struggling with alcohol addiction and it’s taking a toll on me,"I (32F) have a 38-year-old brother who has been dealing with alcoholism for the past 4 to 5 years. He also has OCD, anxiety, and depression, which worsened after the pandemic. Watching his decline has triggered anxiety in me.

He tries every morning to quit but ends up drinking by evening after work. A while back, he fell down while drunk, fractured his skull, and had to be hospitalized. It was a very serious case. Still, the cycle continues. He once asked me to help him stick to his meds, but when I reminded him recently, he lashed out and stopped talking to me. My therapist advised me not to force him, but I feel so helpless.

I am moving abroad soon, and with our ageing parents, I constantly worry. I fear he won’t be able to handle a crisis if something happens to them. I am also scared he might develop a serious illness due to his drinking, especially after a close acquaintance recently passed away from pancreatic cancer.

We have tried psychiatrists, therapists, and medications. Nothing has really helped. Rehab is not an option. My own anxiety is getting worse, and it is affecting my relationship with my husband. I know my interference is pushing my brother away, but I can’t seem to detach emotionally.

How do I support him without losing myself in the process? Any advice would mean a lot.
","I’ve seen this with someone close, and the hardest lesson was realizing you can’t force someone to change if they’re not ready. Show love, stay consistent, but don’t lose yourself trying to carry their battles. || this is one of those situations where there’s no clean fix. loving someone doesn’t mean you have to destroy yourself trying to save them. you’ve already tried. you’ve shown up. and if he’s not taking the rope you’re throwing him then it’s okay to stop throwing for a while. keeping yourself together matters too. your worry is valid but so is your need for peace. || Your care is heartwharming, i also suffer from anxiety and just booked my first session with a psychiatric therapist. I couldn't go to work yesterday and told the doctor my how i honestly feel, he wrote me sick for that one day and booked my a session for a psychiatric therapist. I am much younger than you and your brother but i also abuse alcohol whenever i can, it just numbs me and that results into excessive drinking. My parents worry about me already and that makes me even more anxious. I don't know what your brother goes through that he became an alcoholic. But i understand why i do it and maybe its similar with him, unfortunately there is nothing you can make to change his way of thinking and behaviour. The same way nobody can force me to change my unhealthy self medications. Like drinking and not being honest with my family. He has to make the change, nobody besides him can make him do that, i am aware that i will hurt other people around me if i continue my dangerous behaviour. Lose my job, destroy my health and life. So i can only wish you the best and send you lots of hugs, to you and your brother. It is hard for sure but stick with it and give him some time like the others here already wrote. There is not much you can do but love him. Sending lots of support and love. Greetings x || It has become a do or die situation for me. If I am there, then I have to be entirely involved. And if not, then I need to completely detach myself from him. The only thing is that I don't know how to initiate the process of detachment. Is it through anger or through hate? Also, what is healthy detachment? || Thank you for the reply. You are absolutely right. I too feel I should take a step back and accept the fate that is coming. However, I am not comfortable accepting the idea of death and that is one thought that is keeping me up all night. I have lost my appetite, my libido has dropped and there's a constant tightness around my chest. I don't know what exactly do I need to do that will give me a little amount of peace.

I'm so confused,"I (m) (29) used to suffer from anxiety and panic attacks fairly frequently between 16 and 22 then one day they disappeared, then 4 months ago everything came back but 10x more intense but also different.
I've spent the whole last 4 months in a 24/7 constant state of anxiety

Every day it's shortness of breath and palpitations and just a general feeling of restlessness, I feel like I can feel the anxiety sitting on my shoulders.
I dont get a single moment to feel 'normal'
When i sleep I wake up multiple times a night tossing and turning with endless anxious thoughts.

I'm constantly irritable, constantly fatigued, constantly have digestive issues all aches and pains in all these different places in my body.

The thing the scares me now tho is when I have panic attacks there the complete opposite of what I experienced years ago.
I used to be able to tell it was a panic attack based on some small symptoms I'd have during them.

Now my heart doesn't even race, I have a resting heart rate of 64 and it doesn't even move during the panic.
I get right sided chest pain instead of left, my heart doesn't pound, I don't get dizzy or light headed or anything that used to come with my panic attacks.

I just get an insanely intense feeling of impending doom and restlessness, that panic feeling, I then go to the er and nothing is wrong.

I've been to the hospital 17 times in 4 months because this won't stop.
Previously my panic would stop in a medical setting and now it just gets worse. 

It's like my anxiety has come back but everything is now the opposite and I dont know how to calm it down, none of my old coping mechanisms work or breathing techniques, I'm just stuck here and I can't get out.

Starting an SSRI,"I’ve suffered from GAD and panic disorder for most of my life. I’ve kept it more than tolerable with lifestyle and healthy habits. I lift, do yoga, meditate, eat clean etc. Two weeks ago I had a major panic attack that put me down for three days. Since then my anxiety has been through the roof every day.

I get adequate sunlight, spend a lot of time outdoors and do everything I can to keep my mind and body healthy. None of that is working currently.

Extreme adult separation anxiety,"I have had separation anxiety for as long as I can remember and it is crippling. I guess I never “outgrew” it as a child. I used to have it towards my parents but when I got married, it carried over to my spouse as he travels a few times a year. Now that I am a mom, it has went away towards my husband and is now towards my son. It consumes me. I hate traveling, I hate being away from him. I am going away with my husband for 2 nights (driving 5 hours) in a couple weeks and I am literally spiraling already. We had to cancel our trip last month due to illness and I was relieved. I just want to be normal. I want to be able to enjoy the time away with my husband to reconnect. I know logically that it is a short time away from my son. We gave him the choice to come with us or go with his grandparents who he adores and is with during the week as my husband and I both work. I am so proud of him for choosing to go with them and not suffering like I do. When I was younger, I hated staying with my grandparents due to my anxiety and just wanted my parents. The last thing I want is for my son to know how bad this affects me. I want him to have a wonderful time with his grandparents. I know  he will be in good hands but as someone who has general anxiety disorder as well, I worry about all the what ifs that can happen. I also feel like I’m going to miss him so terribly.

Looking for real examples of negative self-talk,"Hi everyone,

I’m doing a bit of research to better understand the kinds of thoughts people struggle with—especially the harsh, judgmental, or unhelpful ones that pop up in your head when you’re stressed, stuck, or feeling low.

If you’re open to sharing: What are the *exact words or phrases* your inner critic tends to say?

Not paraphrased or cleaned up, just raw, how it shows up in your mind.

Examples could be things like:

* “You’re so behind. Everyone else has figured it out.”
* “You always mess things up.”
* “don't be a burden you shouldn't ask for help .”

No pressure to explain or justify—just the quotes themselves are super helpful.

This is for a project I’m working on around self-esteem and what modalities can help.

Thank you for being open and raw.","If its about my insecurities, the main ones are definitely ‘why cant i be loved’ or ‘im so unlovable’ along with (if i see another pretty girl) ‘why cant i be pretty?’ || My most common thought is thinking that my only positive trait is being pretty, so when I don’t look pretty, I get really harsh on myself. I also tend to feel a weird sense of shame when being sexual, despite it being completely normal and okay. I have weird guilty tendencies where if I don’t do something that’s morally correct I beat myself up over it for months and months. Like one of your examples, I also tend to feel burdened when asking for help, or like I’m being annoying, so I just don’t.

Also, I have adhd, so I tend to get really excited over something related to my hyperfixation, which is a show that’s referred to as cringe and embarrassing. When I talk about it, I get this weird thought in my head that tells me to shut up and that nobody cares.

I hope some of this can be of help for your project. Good luck! || For me it doesn't have to be overtly negative, it's subtle and it ends up going against my own interests. 

""She probably has a boyfriend"", ""I don't do anything when I'm off work, I have no hobbies"", ""My home will never be in good enough shape to want to invite someone over"" are good examples.",1753763475.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc24ud/looking_for_real_examples_of_negative_selftalk/,Anxiety

It just feels like I'm never going to be able to have a good enough future to fulfill my dreams and get the things I want. 

Right now all I'm doing is taking my newly prescribed meds and bed rotting all day. Kinda lost hope in my future and I don't really have any desire to change for the better. Really really want to give up.

Books Are My Safe Space During Anxiety. Just Wanted to Share That.,"Whenever I feel overwhelmed or anxious, I turn to books, especially fiction.
Getting lost in a good mystery or emotional story really helps quiet my thoughts. Even reading just a few pages can calm me down way more effectively than watching TV, since reading requires more focus and keeps my mind from spiraling.

Just thought I’d share in case it helps someone else too.
If anyone has comforting or intense book recommendations that helped them during tough times, I’d love to hear them!

Do you find value in psychology/psychiatry?,"I read a post the other day either in a sub (it might have been this one, I don't remember) about the cost of psychiatrists and it got me thinking about the value of psychology/psychiatry in relation to the cost. Generally, I think if an object/service is expensive and the value is high, that's ok, but if the object/service is expensive and the value is low, that's not ok.

Getting to the point, I've seen 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists in the past 13 years for chronic mental health challenges and I'm not convinced of the value. I'm seeing a new psychologist this week and I'm a bit apprehensive. Not about the experience (I'm a pretty open book), but about whether there's value in it. Mental health care in Australia is quite expensive, even with the Mental Health Care Plan rebate, so thinking about it in terms of cost vs. benefit and I'm not 100% convinced it's worth the time and money.

I'm going to go either way, but I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts and experiences.",No. It is guesswork at best.,1753791712.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc9y0m/do_you_find_value_in_psychologypsychiatry/,Anxiety
Having nonstop panic attacks about moving away from road noise,"My anxiety has been in a severe state recently. Really really bad. There is road noise in my apartment which has bothered me for so long. I’m not sure if it’s a contributor to my anxiety/panic attacks or if it’s just something my mind focuses on when it’s anxious.

After a lot of searching, I found a new apartment in the area that is much quieter. The only thing that’s a downgrade is the shared washer dryer in the building.

I put a deposit to move in but now I’ve been having massive panic attacks about the move and can’t even sleep so I don’t think I can even manage to conduct the move after multiple nights of no sleep.

What should I do? Should I ask for the deposit back/forego it and try to accept the road noise?",,1753790579.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc9k0i/having_nonstop_panic_attacks_about_moving_away/,Anxiety
Leg pain,"So I've had anxiety for as long as I can recall- in childhood I was constantly in fight or flight as there was constant chaos. I'm almost 35 now and feel I have processed a lot of it and still regularly do therapy. However I feel like my body is still constantly in anxiety mode (I know that maybe doesn't make sense). I often struggle with nerve pain in the evenings when I get home from work and try to go to bed. Exercise, diet or routine doesn't seem to make a difference. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Do I sound crazy?? It feels like a burning and slight throb sort of sensation/pain that usually radiates around my knees all the way down my shins and ankles. I often toss and turn until I slather my legs with creams or patches, even then I often have to take something to help me sleep. I have a tens unit that is amazing, but it's a pain in the ass to fall asleep with and the second I turn it off my pain returns.",May be a nerve or muscle issue.

Effexor for anxiety/social anxiety - worried about side effects after first dose??,"Hi everyone,  
I wanted to ask for some advice or shared experiences about Effexor (venlafaxine), especially for anxiety and social anxiety.

I tried 75mg once (extended release) a while back and had an intense reaction — I didn’t sleep a single minute that night and felt super wired like I was on a recreational stimulant, had jaw clenching/grinding, and ended up having my first proper panic attack the next day. It really scared me, so I stopped right away.

Now I’m reconsidering trying a lower dose (37.5mg), but I’m nervous. I’m a highly sensitive person, have some past trauma from drug experiences (weed/MDMA/psychadelics) that left me hypervigilant, and I suspect I may be autistic. I’m worried about persistent insomnia or overstimulation happening again, especially because sleep is already fragile for me.

I’m wondering:

Has anyone had a bad first experience on 75mg and done better on 37.5mg?

Did it help with your anxiety/social anxiety in the long run?

Any tips for managing the early side effects, especially if you’re very sensitive?

I really want to find something that helps, but I’m scared to mess up my nervous system even more.

Thanks for reading 💙","Hello, I was on this. The only side effect I had was slightly blurred long distance vision for few days. 

It help a lot with my anxiety as a whole. But more with regular anxiety than social anxiety. Though to a degree with that, too. But I also have OCD and with lots of those symptoms it didn't help and I needed secondary medication on top of that. Specifically Pregabalin. That did help with social anxiety, too. 

As for how to manage side effects, I don't think that can be answered broadly like that. It comes do to which specific side effects if any you might get. It shouldn't be anything too bad though either way.",1753790045.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc9dcw/effexor_for_anxietysocial_anxiety_worried_about/,Anxiety
Attending a culturally different wedding,"Hey everyone,

As the title hints, I am attending my partner's (M28) brother wedding. We have been together for well over 2 years now (got a house, cats and a future together) and so his family knows me as we met couple times or stayed over at theirs.

The thing is that, my partner is British and his family is that type that I have always imagined exists only in like Bridgerton style books etc. I on the other hand am Czech (coming from a small quite poor city as well, so imagine a true slavic girl). And even tho this might sound a bit bizarre or like a perfect romance novel motive, I'm genuinely getting more and more anxious about attending the wedding. 

There has been a couple things over the past few months that gave me the idea of what kind of wedding is this gonna be. The fact that it's going to be in a massive Abbey, the after lunch hosted in a big venue, three/four course meal for everyone, my partners mom asking me if im planning on wearing a hat (I mean...HAT ? Like I've never even thought about it), the groom being very strict about male guest wearing tailcoats (again...I had to Google what is a tailcoat lol). So in short, I got a feeling from all of this that it's going to be a bit of an aristocracy style wedding. Which is actually pretty cool because I've never seen anything like that..

BUT

I'm starting to be terrified on making some sort of mistake, saying something wrong. Also, my arms are covered in tattoos, I got two nose piercings and yeaaaah a minor slavic accent and I'm just getting anxious af :))) I'm trying to get ready as much as possible to fit in, got a very modest pink dress (length under knees as that was also one of the requirements), I'm planning on buying a vape (because obviously as a  true slavic girl, I smoke a bit, but got the idea that that's not acceptable for this occasion so I'll occasionally hide at toilets with my little vape), having my nails done, haircut and everything you can possibly think of. 

I just...yeah I don't know I think is a mix of being nervous, excited about experiencing something completely new to me, anxious for not fitting in in the slightest and -  I am very happy with how I am, how I look and act and everything, but objectively I recognise that it is very different to what this wedding and the whole culture of my partners family is.

I guess I just needed to vent that out. So thanks for reading x",,1753789937.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc9c48/attending_a_culturally_different_wedding/,Anxiety
I don’t know what I’m feeling… but I need help,"Hi. I’m really struggling right now, and I don’t know how to explain it well. I’ve been having strong urges to cry or hit myself, and I don’t want to feel this way.

Whenever I get anxious, this feeling grows — like I want someone to hit me so I can feel it harder, even though I don’t *like* that. It’s not about liking pain, it’s just that something in me feels like it *needs* that release. It’s scary and exhausting.

When I was a kid, I used to hurt myself — punching, biting, hitting my head against a wall. I even hit my foot with a spoon once when I was angry at my mom. I eventually stopped, but these thoughts still come back sometimes. I don’t act on them anymore, but they’re always there in the background.

Right now, I feel like if I could just cry, I’d feel a little better. But I live in a joint family, and there’s no private space to let it out. It feels like everything is just trapped inside me.

I don’t know if anyone will understand this, but if you’ve felt anything like this — or even if you haven’t — I’d really appreciate someone to talk to or just hear me.

Thank you for reading.","In general bottling up emotions is not good. They eventually get released somewhere and the effect can be explosive. Let those tears out, it's far less damaging than hurting yourself.

Is walking really worth it?,"Hello, I'm suffering from a series of severe anxiety and also OCD with intrusive thoughts, and this is really making me feel bad.
I don't leave the house often, I stay locked in my room all day and only when necessary do I leave the house, like shopping or going out to eat.
So I want to know, does walking really reduce anxiety and OCD? I'm planning to start walking every afternoon for the week, and I want to know if this will really help me. I would like to hear the opinion of someone who suffers from anxiety and has started exercising.","It does. Walking for at least 30 mins a day reduces cortisol. I’m an anxiety sufferer as well, I like to walk in the evening right before sunset/or during, find it more relaxing. || Absolutely, especially in your case. Humans *need* sunlight, fresh air, and movement and will feel like shit without it. Not only that, but going outside and walking will help slowly expose you to things which should help lessen your anxiety. 

The thing with anxiety is that by avoiding, you’re actually reinforcing your anxiety. You’re conditioning yourself to listen to it, that the anxiety and fear is correct. This makes it even harder to get over when you have to. Similar with compulsions—every time you go through with them, followed by the desired outcome (bad thing doesn’t happen), your conditioning yourself to believe that you have to do this to get that result. You’re feeding into it. 

I can get depressive episodes, which sometimes include suicidal feelings. One time it lasted for a month. Guess what else happened that month? Nothing, because I didn’t leave the house. Then I had to go out for an errand and suddenly it was over. My god I felt better. So now if I feel an episode coming on, the very first thing I do is go for a walk. || Yes, yes yes and million times yes ... this will help you in ways you can't imagine. If you can, bring a bottle of water with you, and leave the phone at home (and don't worry nothing will happen while you're gone for your walk, it's YOU time). Keep it short and fun, 20-25minutes will do you wonders. || Yes. Studies show exercise is as effective as antidepressants in reducing mild to moderate depression. It causes changes in the brain and releases dopamine. I have anxiety and I try to walk 20 mins a day. I used to hike 5 miles a day but my senior dog can't go with me anymore so I stopped. I felt a LOT better when I used to hit the trails. Nature and exercise goes a long way to make me feel better. || Walking is my #1 anxiety remedy. 


My anxiety has improved a lot over the years and getting out of the house and get the body moving is one the top factors for improving my situation. Even now, whenever I get anxious, the first thing I do is *get out of the house.* If you can walk in any type of nature that's preferable but just a walk in your block or city helps. Bonus points if you can go somewhere where your eyes can see the horizon (there's research that show how Panoramic Vision helps reduce stress). But yeah, staying indoors is just the absolute worst I can do. || Yes, it will definitely help, particularly if you’re finding it hard to leave the house - we’ve all been there! Take it slow, plan a treat (I often walk to a cafe or get a yummy sandwich if I’m struggling) and maybe do it with a friend or family member. Good luck! || You should walk regardless. It won't cure anxiety but it might reduce it. || It is one of the only things that helps with my anxiety. Than and propananol || Yeah, I've got anxiety too and walking daily has been a game-changer for easing my OCD thoughts and getting me out of that room rut || Any exercise helps. Walking is easy. I know it's hard to get started but try. 💜 || It helps me so much that my anxiety noticeably worsens during summer when it is too hot to go outside.  || Yes. Even if you don't feel better in the moment you're giving your mind a break. It's also a good opportunity to practise mindfulness because thoughts will pop up eventually || For me it helps 
I used to spend 3months of summer break at home and only go out 3 times.
I started walking with my dad every night and I'd say it definitely helps,I'm trying to make it a daily thing but even when I can't walk I just stay at home and do any fun workout. || stay strong ✊️ || Yes! Love my daily walks || I've recently started walking 40 minutes a day to work for about 6 months now instead of transit the whole way.

My mental and physical health are 10x better no joke. It helps your entire body; digestive system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and general muscle use. This all comes through in our brain telling us ""good job maintaining yourself, have some happy chemicals"" || I have GAD panic disorder ocd also a month and a half I completely changed my eating habits and walk after dinner and my anxiety is a lot better I also go stand outside barefoot in the grass to help ground myself || Yes it is. It’s a form of therapy for me. || Yes, very much so, but I still struggle to get myself out some days || 100%. Staying locked in your room, alone, isolated isn't good for your mental health. Take a brisk 20-30 minute walk, get some fresh air and sunshine. It won't solve everything, but can help you feel a little better...

Involved In A Car Crash. Been Discharged From Several Different ER’s. Developed Intense Anxiety/Stress Over The Situation.,"I was involved in a car crash a little over two weeks ago and I wasn’t sure if I hit my head as I have no visible bruises, grazes, cuts or lumps and my head doesn’t really hurt. It all happened so quick as well so I’m just not 100% sure if I hit it or not. I went to the hospital and they discharged me after checking me and doing multiple neurological exams. They said it could possibly be a mild concussion and that it’d get better over time. The only symptoms I’ve had since the crash are mild headaches (don’t last long), dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue/drowsiness, hot/cold flashes and just a feeling of detachment. I just don’t feel like myself. It gets better when I go out and exercise and when I’m distracted by other things, but as soon as the thought of a serious head injury enters my brain again I start feeling worse. I’ve had really bad health anxiety in the past and I had gotten over it, but the crash has just triggered it again I think. I went to multiple hospitals - not just one.

"I’m not sure what’s going on with me, please advice","Hi everyone, I have steadily over the course of a few years developed like major anxiety around illness. It probably started around 3-4 years ago when my firstborn started daycare and was sick weekly from September until February. Then * I * started getting sick even more often than my kids and found out I might be some type of immune compromised.  

It’s gotten so bad that I can’t comfort my children when they have even a low grade fever because I feel like I’m going to die and I’m terrified of getting sick. I also **have** to knock on wood whenever something about illness is spoken about or else I “just know” it’s going to be a jinx and actually going to happen (for example I was at the rheumatologist yesterday and had to knock on wood like 10+ times whenever he asked me if something hurt and it didn’t actually hurt (yet)). My husband joked about lying about one of the kids being sick to get us out of going to a family bbq (outdoors and not many people) and then my daughter literally got sick that day and I just KNOW it’s because he even said that out loud. 

I also won’t go to family parties or concerts or a bar any event where I know I’ll be breathing people’s air or squished up against people for a prolonged period of time. Ive resorted to taking Xanax to even help me sleep because I’m too wired and anxious to rest (not every night don’t worry). My hands are cracking from using hand sanitizer like 50 times a day whenever I touch something that my daughter may have touched (she has a fever right now which sparked this current freak out of mine). 

I was diagnosed with GAD back when I was 17 or 18 (28 now) but this is the worse I’ve experienced. I also had 2 miscarriages and a severe illness this year that I’m still recovering from, and I’m convinced something is medically wrong ALL THE TIME. I’ve started therapy but hasn’t done much of anything yet. Any advice on how to make it through this day to day???

**EDIT TO ADD** 
 - I also was prescribed lexapro and Wellbutrin from my PCPs to try to help with my anxiety, but I can’t take them. I’m convinced that if I take them it’ll make me feel sick and it’ll fuck up the chemicals in my brain. I have constant tension headaches from the lack of sleep and from constantly clenching my jaw SO hard. When I realize I’m doing it, I stop but like a minute later I’m back to it. I HAVE to cook almost all of my food from scratch or else it’s going to get me sick. The exception is Oreos for some reason. But even then I only have one Oreo per day because they’re processed and I’m convinced they’ll hurt me. I also have to try to pee 50 times before going to bed or else I’ll be too anxious to fall asleep because I’ll be convinced that I’m going to have to pee in an hour. ","Have you been diagnosed with ocd || This sounds like OCD. It's funny that you say you were prescribed wellbutrin and lexapro because I am on both of those right now and I have anxiety and OCD. So honestly, you sound a lot like me haha. I have major health anxiety/OCD. I have noticed that as I get older it has gotten worse. Things like that can unfortunately worsen with age. I am 29 now and a mother to a 2 year old. It really is hard sometimes. But, even though it is hard I really think you should try taking the medicines prescribed to you. I can say for sure they both help to keep me in line. I wouldn't say all the anxiety or compulsions are completely gone since I do have a bad day every once in a while, but it really does make it much more manageable. I would also like to suggest CBD gummies (of course consult with your doctor first) because I also use to take those and it helped with panic attacks. I say 'use to take' because I just vape THC now (it is legal in my state) and it helps to calm me down. I don't know how you feel about smoking marijuana or smoking it in the form of THC vapes but it could be beneficial or it could not, some people it can make them more nervous. But anyway I promise you will get through this rough mental health patch. Trust me there were times I thought I was DYING. One night years ago I had a bad panic attack all night throwing up over and over from the anxiety and my chest hurt so bad I thought I was having a heart attack, but nope it was just a panic attack. But here I am today doing much better. Things will get better, you just have to find the right treatment regimen that works best for you. Much love! <3 || Hello, it sounds like OCD to me. 

I can relate to probably all of these symptoms. If it's that bad, you need to start the Lexapro or something like that, as it's just too severe. But I understand you're scared of it. 

And it would help if you'd be practicing radical acceptance and exposure therapy techniques. Are you familiar with it? And do you understand how these fears and thoughts work in terms of how it's from having low tolerance of uncertainty? || No not at this time.. maybe I should see a psychiatrist? I’ve just been seeing my PCP and a therapist (only have gone twice so far) || I’m 28 with a 5yo and (almost) 3yo so we are similar there too! I tried a weed vape for the first time in like 6 years the other day and I think it just made my anxiety worse unfortunately. But would be willing to give CBD a shot! Both are legal in my state too. I’ve had significant health issues this year (2 miscarriages and a severe gastrointestinal illness) so I’m even MORE terrified of trying any medication that can potentially cause negative side effects like the lexapro and Wellbutrin 🙁 I took ONE Wellbutrin when it was prescribed a little over a month ago and then I had a horrible headache all day (unrelated I’m sure) and I decided I can’t do it. The lexapro, I didn’t even try. I picked it up from the CVS and was like maybe I’ll take this someday when I calm down a bit 😭 || I’m unfamiliar with radical acceptance techniques. Exposure therapy I would assume is like touching germs and not immediately feeling like I’m going to die or puke or get incredibly sick? || I’m not a psychiatrist in any way but it sounds a little like OCD, which go hand in hand usually. || That can be part of exposure therapy. Also for example acting against those magical thinking thoughts. For example if you're afraid how not doing some ritual will result in something terrible, you shouldn't do it on purpose or do the ritual wrong on purpose. But for the most part it's about just forcing yourself to go about everything as if these fears weren't a factor. It includes not avoiding anything, no repeated checking, no seeking reassurance and things like that. Simply as if you didn't have this problem. 

And radical acceptance is telling yourself how if what you're afraid of is true or is going to happen, it's fine. That's it. It's as if you're telling that to the fear and thoughts rather than to yourself.

Anxiety stole my life,"Hey, so I've been thinking about this a lot and just need some advice. Four years ago I changed basically everything, I've finished my bachelors in psychology, got into my dream art academy I was afraid to pursue, basically I had everything going well. Then I had struggled with so much anxiety I broke apart and basically got stuck in my bed staring at the phone 12 hours a day, not going out not doing anything. I was also sort of betrayed by the Church, dealing with a lot of trauma from that and also a few bad relationships. I tried to do everything therapy, pills, prayers... all of it worked just very slowly. In this process I lost a lot of confidence, all sources of income and I was back at the uni in my hometown living in my parents house. Now three years later I was able to fly for the first time, see the ocean, do a lot of things that might come naturally to many people, but for me it was an uphill battle rather than a vacation. I fear there is no way out of this. I am 26F now and I have no relationship and no money, no prospects, am becoming a burden to my parents and I'm scared. Can anyone tell me there is a way out? Is it antidepressants? Is it prayer, working out, therapy? Idk what to do. Please help.","Exercise helps me a lot! Doesn’t bring me back to 100%, but it cuts down like 20% of the anxiety when every other mindfulness tip and trick only does about 1%. 

If faith is what you need to get through this, lean on faith. But don’t let it stop you from getting help from other avenues. Reaching out to a therapist is a great first step. Seeing a psychiatrist is another. I’m not saying medication is your solution, but it’s possible it could help. Anything is worth a try.

You got this <3 || As someone much elder and sailing in a similar boat, let me congratulate you for flying and travelling beating odds. You are already a winner. These small steps will help you conquer life. Sorry for all that you are going through. Anxiety is extremely challenging. But a combination of therapies, physical exercise, movement, meditation, lifestyle changes, mind techniques and many other methods can completely lower its impact. Basically try out things and see what works best for you. There is no one size fits all solution here. You have a lot of life ahead. So patiently navigate yourself out of it. All the best. || I’ve experienced the same thing since I was 16, and now I’m 23.

advice on how to deal with chronic nausea,ive had GAD and emetephobia for as long as i can remember and it creates this very unhelpful loop of feeling nauseous because i’m anxious then feeling anxious bc i’m nauseous etc etc. it’s like a pushing feeling in my throat and jaw that makes me want to gag. i was on SSRI’s for about two years but i felt they just numbed me out so i’m not sure how keen i am on starting them again especially since i’m going to be moving abroad and travelling a lot in the next few months. which brings me back to my original question: i am incredibly anxious about moving and travelling so the nausea has increased tenfold. what physical or mental tricks do you guys use to keep the feeling at bay or calm yourself down? since it’s starting to interfere with my life and being in public ,"So when you eat something that’s off, or get salmonella or norovirus etc, your stomach reacts the only way it can to get rid of it for you- vomiting (fight mode). Stomach has identified the threat, wants to keep you alive (thanks stomach!) When someone feels anxious they can feel sick because the brain tells the body to look out for threats - freeze mode (fight-flight-feeeze-fawn- one of the 4 threat responses we just never talk about it). Actively retching is more like flight mode! The stomach gets the message from the brain that there are threats about and goes into -I’m ready to be sick mode- or actively gets you to retch because it’s scared the imminent threat is going to kill you (thanks again stomach!) You have to actively speak to the subconsious to reassure it that the situation you’re in is not going to kill you- your brain is overdoing the threat response and your body is running right along with it. Repeat that you’re safe to yourself when you’re having to do anything scary and when eating every bite. Being scared of being sick is kind of counterintuitive too, because your body is doing exactly what it can only do to keep you alive- that’s it’s sole mission. So say ‘thank you body for doing these things but I don’t need you to- because we’re safe’. your brain is reacting like you’re about to get eaten by a sabre tooth tiger whilst out gathering food because it’s reaponses are v limited and rooted in evolution. Tell the brain you’re not going to die from X Y or Z and the subconsious will start to believe it. || Investigate if the nausea isn't just the common throat tightness that's like a cornerstone anxiety symptom:) that was my big issue. I'm emetophobic and didn't realize that I didn't actually know what real nausea felt like || I’m here because I have this issue too. I have an “oh shit kit” on me that has ginger candies, lemon drops, zofran, bonine (anti-nausea over the counter) and I keep a list on my phone of all of the pressure points i know that I can press when feeling nauseous. 

I also keep a mental list of “safe foods” - things I’ve eaten that have never made me sick. I remind my brain and stomach when I eat them that they’re safe. This seems to keep the nausea from coming.

But honestly once I’m nauseous, very little helps- and the anxiety of “this might make me nauseous” can be overpowering and frightening.

I have signed up to try EMDR with my counselor, I plan on reporting how it goes. 

I’m so sorry you’re suffering with this. || I take Zofran (anti nausea) med almost daily. It helps a lot || Just adding that the brain generally can't hear thoughts or words like that, so you gotta show it through action that you're safe! || Harmful advice for emetophobics || Zofran works so good but it makes me so constipated. Like I will go 2 weeks without going and then that makes me nauseous || yesss zofran helps me soo much as i suffer with anxiety from nausea || Really?? That stinks.

Answered a phone call and now I’m scared my voice will be cloned,"I normally don’t answer phone calls from unknown numbers but I don’t know what possessed me to answer a call today. It was some guy saying he had an offer for HVAC tune ups and I said maybe 2-3 few word sentences over the span of 1 minute 

How likely is it that my voice will be cloned and used to scam me or my loved ones?","They won't, it takes a lot more samples of a voice to clone it. One tip is to never say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to unknown calls, this way they won't be able to use those recordings to impersonate you. || I have never heard of this happening. I’m not saying it’s *impossible*, but the sheer amount of effort in an attempt to scam only a few people makes this so unlikely that being scared of it would probably be considered paranoid. You are not important enough to do this to you. 

If you often have fears like this, please talk to your doctor/therapist. This fear is unreasonable enough to surpass anxiety into paranoia and you should see someone in case it escalates. || There’s not even a remote chance this will happen, I promise you. A couple of years ago, I accidentally answered a scammy call (only because the spoofed number area code was my Dad’s area and I had that horrible “something bad happened to him” panic. Otherwise, I’d have ignored it). I talked to them briefly before realising it was a scam, told them to eff off and hung up. I did worry about voice cloning, but OP, think about the millions of scammy calls made across the world every day. Nothing comes of them unless you part with your SSN or banking details.

You’re OK. Nothing bad will happen. || If you all said was hello, then that's not enough to do a real voice clone.

OCD destroying me over something that happened today. Please help!!!,"
TW: mentions of suicidal thoughts

So I have severe OCD, and my main fear is being an abuser or predator. Like. I do ANYTHING I can to make sure I am never that way. It’s called POCD.

And today I saw a meme of an old model today talking about her boobs that made me feel really aroused and I went to… do the deed. 

I didn’t use that photo, only content that I was certain was 18+ by checking subreddit rules, but then after I started to spiral and it turns out the model that I initially felt aroused by started her career at 16, and I’m not sure if she was of age in the initial photo I saw. Now my intrusive thoughts are telling me the worst stuff ever.

From everything I can tell, she was probably 18 or 19 in the photo that I saw, but I hate that I don’t know for sure. Please please please help I am evil and hate myself I NEVER EVER EVER have had any attraction to anyone under the age of 18 and I really really really really hope that this wasn’t the worst case scenario because if it was I think I would actually probably kill myself.","To me, what matters is people’s intentions. You thought she was 18,19 years old and that’s what matters. || You aren’t a pedo if you think it was wrong if she was under age. Pedos don’t believe it’s wrong. Don’t listen to your thoughts || You’re not being a pedo, you were attracted to a person that looks womanly, not a child like body 
Please don’t believe your thoughts || Fellow OCD sufferer here but with a different theme. It’s so tempting to drink from the well of reassurance. You’ve posted this in 5 separate subs  hoping to read all the comments reassuring you that you aren’t what you fear, and hoping this reduces the anxiety. It may (or may not) work short therm but like drinking salt water from the ocean, it will just leave you even thirstier in the end. It’s a struggle but the main thing is to recognize this is the disease talking. Your post history suggests you may have some access to professional therapy. Stay the course. It’s a long hard road but worthwhile. Best of luck. || Hi! 

You might be suffering from intrusive thoughts. I had the same issue but with other thoughts. Ex: I believe that I wanted to commit ☠️ because my mind wouldn’t stop having intrusive suicidal thoughts. I finally came across this link https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/unwanted-intrusive-thoughts

Which then lead me to their book they wrote https://a.co/d/6WXr1fv

The book helped tremendously. I recommend checking out the first link to help kind of comfort you and calm you down and then buy the book if you can. You’re not crazy, you’re not alone. Hope this helps, hang in there!  || What helps me with my OCD is that I try to realize what is bothering me. In my case, it seems like the root cause of fear of being a creep isn’t any actions taken, but it’s fear of being seen as a creep. I try and realize that there are good and understanding people. Also, all we have is the information given to us, and we make decisions based on that. You thought she was older, so you made a decision. Then, when you thought she was (possibly) younger, you made another decision. Instead of trying to put together the puzzle pieces and figure out how everything plays together in the grand scheme of the labyrinth of your mind, try and just remember that you make choices with the information that you have in the moment, and the choices you make, and why you make them, are what’s important. Not how everything could have fit together in some elaborate way in retrospect to paint you as a monster. Time in therapy also helped me greatly.

Best wishez,

Fellow OCD guy || hi, you can message me if you want to || I just turned 19 myself and since I turned 18 last year this fear of being a creep has just gotten so out of control || I didn’t find out til afterwards that she began her career at 16, it may be TMI but she was featured in 80s and 90s magazines starting at the age of 16 which I think is super fucked up but her career didn’t take off until a few years later.

Living 24/7 with hyperactivity that’s so extreme that it’s painful to be still, having almost zero self control and being unable to focus on most things for more than a few seconds.

In adulthood these symptoms often lead to loving many jobs, unemployment, bankruptcy, homelessness, trouble with the law imprisonment, more frequent car accidents and other accidents, great difficulty maintaining relationships, addiction problems, extreme difficulty with self care, inability to participate in hobbies or do simple things like read a book or watch a movie.",1753777867.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc6038/so_i_see_how_people_defend_adhd_and_that_they/,Anxiety
Is 50mg Hydroxyzine too much for first time?,"I had my first intense panic attack at work last week. It felt like my heart stopped for a second and I got dizzy, my heart rate was through the roof, and I was shaking like crazy. I had to go to urgent care to get clearance to be able to go back to work, and the doctor offered to prescribe me hydroxyzine. I declined it because I’ve never taken any sort of medication for anxiety or mental health and I wasn’t ready to say yes. Today I called the doctor and asked if I could actually have it, so I picked that up today. 

I was reading about it and other people keep saying they’ve been given 25mg. I was prescribed 50mg, so that makes me worry if maybe that’s too much?

Graduated but haven't used degree...,"There's plenty of posts out there about this - finishing a degree but not going on to use it/using it for something completely different.

Long story short I've determined that it's most likely social anxiety that's led to my 5 year dormancy and due to recent circumstances I've dug the degree grave up...

During my internship I would fear not being able to please the boss/couldn't sit still for long. This led to constant dissociation, which meant I couldn't absorb any new learnings, which exacerbated the loop etc. I did well at uni, but felt a bit imposter syndrome about it.

I went to the hospital, nothing was wrong except for my heart rate being through the roof and my blood pressure was high- told me it was anxiety/panic.

I had no one to go to, family dismissed me and told me it was just something we all have to deal with. For years I believed that. But I was so afraid of having another panic attack that I boxed myself in so small that I wouldn’t go anywhere alone. For me, I tried everything before seeking professional help.

My detailed journey with anxiety for the past 2 and a half years,"Thought I'll share a detailed journey of my GAD, including the symptoms, medicine and other experiences I've had a long the way.

Where it all began:  
A week after after having covid at the end of December of 2022 I suddenly felt weakness in my left leg and tightness in my chest along with some dizziness. At the time I had no idea what it was, I got super panicy and went to ER, where they of course told me that everything was fine and most likely it has something to do with anxiety. I'd never experienced any anxiety without a very clear reason for having one before that moment. The next day I felt super anxious and with tightness in my chest, of course worried crazy and thinking that I'm dying. I kept googling my symptoms and of course everything said that it's cancer or I'm having a heart problems or something else completely crazy. I got a full blood panel and general check-up that came back ok.

I went to see psychologist a month or so later, who immediately prescribed me Lexapro. Somehow things got worse pretty fast after starting the medicine. I was throwing up, waking up super early (5-6am) with nausea and strong anxiety. I was coping with that by going on long walks, that helped me start the day. Turned out I was super sensitive (and still am) to most antidepressants.

What helped:  
After trial and error I ended up taking Prozac from mid 2023 till March 2025. It took me 6 weeks for the medicine to actually start working and worst of the side effects to disappear. I struggled with waking up early with nausea for months, before I was prescribed Trazodone, that took around a week to get rid of this problem. From the end of 2023 until the December of 2024 I was more or less ok, very little anxiety but I felt also emotionless, felt like Prozac and Trazadone really made me just exist, but not live my life to the fullest, which of course, was better than the hell I went through before taking them.

Something changed:  
In December of 2024 I suddenly started having problems with falling asleep. I was super tired, but my body kept waking me up when dozing off, feeling like I need to move my body and it kept happening for hours before I finally fall asleep. My doc decided to stop Prozac as in general my anxiety was better and I also felt like I would be more like myself without the medicine. Because I'm sensitive to SSRI I was only taking 10mg, so I went to 5mg for several weeks and then stopped taking it, while still taking Trazadone for sleep. Well - here come the withdrawal effects. Random bursts of anxiety, sleepiness, digestive issues, nausea - every day was different. But what didn't changes was my sleep - I still had the issue of not falling asleep because of my body wanting to move, although brain almost sleeping. Next step was to stop Trazadone, as doc thought it might not be effective anymore and instead causeing this sleeping issue.

Now it's been roughly a month from stopping Trazadone and two months from stopping Prozac. My sleep is now even worse, instead of my body not allowing me to sleep, now it's my mind, tossing in bed for hours and finally falling asleep aroun 4am. This happens now every single night. I also have excessive daytime sleepiness, feeling sad and hopeless and of course a lot of anxiety.

Conclusion:  
I'm not yet healed. Far from it. I've made some stupid decisions, relying on medicine but not doing enough myself to help me heal. (and so have my doctors, constantly experimenting with doses of my medicines and not allowing me enough time to stabilise on single doze).

What I've learned is you cannot rely on medicine. It's a good helping tool, but please work on making changes to your lifestyle or your life in general. Even though I had moments where I felt like there is nothing wrong with my surrounding, making the smallest changes to my lifestyle have had tremendous effect. Even talking with the people close to me and letting people know what I'm going through will help you out long term.

A little bit about the anxiety symptoms and how I manage them:

1. Heavy feeling on the chest - DON'T GOOGLE IT, if you're really worried talk to your doctor and your doctor says your heart is fine then it's most probably fine. It is a known anxiety symptom and usually goes away once you're not thinking about it anymore :)
2. Dizziness - this happens to me on and off. Splashing some cold water on my face or putting something cold on my neck has been helpful.
3. Headaches - usually I get my headaches from my shoulder or neck, sometimes upper back. They can be really annoying and sometimes get pretty strong and painkillers might not help with them. A hot bath or a shower has been sometimes helpful for me and I usually get them only when startin SSRI as a side effect or during a withdrawal.
4. Pins and needles in hands - they come and go. But, they always eventually go away and are most likely related to the tension of the muscles, same as with the headache. Don't stress about it it's just a bit uncomfortable but you'll eventually forget that you've ever had this!
5. Nausea and no appetite (especially in the mornings) - this happens to me quite often - I still try to force something in, even if it's something small like yoghurt or a banana, I feel like it protects my stomach to have at least something in there.
6. Restlessness - try going for a walk and burning that energy. Getting out of home is important even though might seem very tough.
7. Low motivation - unless you REALLY need to get something done, it's sometimes OK to procrastinate and take it a bit slower. You're healing. Your brain is going through a lot, don't be too harsh on yourself. Setting deadlines might be very helpful in case you need to get something done.
8. Fatigue - ok this one is crazy, it comes in periods of weeks sometimes and I feel like my eyes are just closing as soon as I sit down. I've never felt so tired in my life and OF COURSE this boosts my anxiety by thinking there is something wrong with me. Eventually it just resolves on it's own like nothing ever happened... weird one.
9. Benzos - I do have Valium at home and use it ONLY in emergencies. It is a helpful thought to know that you have something to take the edge off the anxiety when it gets too bad, but sometimes just this thought is already good enough. Benzo addiction is a serious thing and please don't try risking it!

I'm not a doctor nor a good writer, just wanting to share my experience and my thoughts! Please feel free to ask me questions or give me suggestions! :)","I would suggest doing a genetic test for medications. I’m in the process of doing this as my 20mg dose of lexapro seems to not be working anymore as my anxiety has worsened with more panic attacks. I refused to do trial and error with these medicines and will be doing the test through Genesight. It gives the doctor better understanding of what medications will have adverse reactions and not work. Is it foolproof? No. All meds have side effects. I think though this will be the best option for me. || I ended up doing the test and Prozac was in the green, most of the other SSRI’s were problematic. Eventually I feel that prozac was working fine, but I didn’t like how it made me feel (a bit like a zombie, no emotions, impossible to even cry).

Panic attacks in the morning at work and unable to find any methods that help,"I’ve been having what I’m pretty certain are panic/anxiety attacks almost every morning for the last few weeks… they’ve started affecting me at work now and have become so bad I feel like I’m going to throw up and/or legit crap myself which would be genuinely horrific as I work at a kids camp and would rather die than have the campers or my fellow staff members witness that. 
These panic/anxiety attacks consist of moderate to severe dissociation, hot flashes throughout my body, numbness and nausea along with impending doom as to what could happen if these feelings completely take over.
I’ve tried every method for easing these feelings and have been on a number of antidepressant/anxiety meds for the last five years (I’m 18 now) but can’t seem to cope these days.

Anxiety driven checking compulsions,"Does anyone else seriously struggle with anxiety driven checking compulsion?

I’m talking, I have locked the front door but I now need to wiggle the handle for 5 seconds, back away from the door and then go back to the door for one final push on the handle. It’s like my brain doesn’t believe my eyes and my actions and is convinced I’ve not done something! 

I struggle with this for things like locking the front door, locking the car, closing the fridge, turning off the kitchen tap, turning lights off. Sometimes when I’m out I feel the need to constantly check inside my bag even if I did it 5 seconds earlier and saw and touched what I was looking for.

Cleaning the toilet is one that I feel like I cannot stop. After I’ve been to the toilet I always give it a wipe down - I’ll walk into my room and think ‘what if there are stains on the toilet’ so I’ll go back into the bathroom, see that there’s nothing there and go back into my room. However, I always end up having to go back and check the toilet again…  

I’m hoping that someone has any advice/tricks I could use, I feel like I’m losing it a little lol.

chronic dizziness from panic attacks,"okay, here it goes. it’s been almost a year of this hell and i’m finally ready to share my story. in september 2024, i drank caffeine by accident and got a major panic attack in the middle of costco. i hadn’t no idea until a few hours later but it was too late by then. after that, i started to get regular panic attacks every single day. every time i drove, just watching tv, or cooking dinner, it didn’t matter. without fail id have a panic attack. 
i’ve been getting panic attacks since i was 13 (im 25F now) so im not new to them, but this was the worst and most frequent i ever had them in my life. in october, it got so bad that i couldn’t drive, which meant i couldn’t get to school. i decided to take a week off and rest. big mistake. i spent a week in bed and still panicked every day. anxiety all day long. i got no rest. instead, i got slammed with physical symptoms ive never felt before. i’d be laying in bed and it felt like i was on a boat. walking to the bathroom and it felt like the floor beneath me was bouncy and my body was not my body. like i was floating above it or something. i got horrible tinnitus, never stops and its louder in my right ear. among other symptoms not worth mentioning cause they didn’t last through the winter like everything else ive mentioned. i was bed bound. i never returned to school. i barely showered and only got up to use the restroom. i was so useless, my girlfriend was fully supporting me. fast forward to january when i started to do exercises for my jaw and my neck hoping to find some relief. i started to feel so much better. maybe it’s my neck, or maybe it’s my jaw because i do have TMJ disorder. 
in february or march i started to get a few more symptoms, maybe related maybe not. i started to get heart palpitations, i feel them at least once a day, and i feel them more if im laying down on my left side. i also started getting really strange visual disturbances that are incredibly hard to describe but, if i move my hand against a dark background (my black comforter) my hand leaves a streak for just a second. it’s not still images and i can only see the streak if its in my peripheral vision. if im looking at my hand straight on i see nothing. and i only see it when the room is dim, not too bright and not too dark. if im outside in the bright sun, i dont notice this. this symptom scares the living crap out of me and i’m convinced i have a brain tumor with everything else going on. 
anyways, after i was feeling better i was able to help my girlfriend around the house more. a few more months go by and i needed to get rid of my agoraphobia if i ever wanted to finish my degree. i started going out again VERY slowly, and im finally able to go out with very little restrictions. i do take precautions to not get overstimulated but sometimes it happens and i have a panic attack. the important thing is that im doing it. i still have the swaying sensation, predominantly when im laying down but i can also feel it sitting or standing. i still have tinnitus, and when things are bad i still have bad DPDR. i also have a faster than im comfortable with heart rate when im standing, but i think that might be due to the fact that i spent so many months in bed. 
i’d love to know if anyone has a similar story. have you recovered? what did you do to get there? did you find something else wrong that was causing the symptoms? my anxiety tells me i have a brain tumor. i hope it’s wrong. ","i forgot to add that i also have a buzzing feeling in my head. it’s not a sound and i feel it in the back of my head, not always, but definitely every day || Is it when you’re anxious? || i will feel all of these symptoms even when i’m not feeling anxious. i do feel general anxiety daily whether it’s triggered by the symptoms or something else. it’s like a viscous cycle and they’re constantly feeding each other || I’d visit a psychologist and PCP.

"a year later, I still don’t understand why this happened to me","just over a year ago now, i was returning from BC with my dad for a summer getaway. I was a relatively normal kid; not suffering from any major mental health issues, not depressed, and rarely ever “anxious” about anything besides the typical anxiety inducing things like school presentations or roller coaster rides. on my trip everything seemed mostly normal, though i recall having thoughts about my mortality and feeling a little worried about dying. 

When i arrived back to toronto, it all hit me like a mack truck. I was out with my friends a few hours after landing when this unexplainable feeling of unease and helplessness washed over me. i knew something was horribly wrong but i had no idea what was wrong or why it was wrong or what was happening to me. panicking, i ubered home and vomited from the anxiety. i eventually started feeling better and brushed it off before i went to bed. 

a day later, i was with my girlfriend at the time heading to a friends birthday party. it was at this point that i felt this feeling of impending doom for the first time. it wasn’t quite like typical anxiety, my heart wasn’t racing and my breath wasn’t funny but i felt frozen and totally and utterly hopeless. like something horrible was imminent and there was nothing i could do to stop it. i felt like this the duration of the birthday party until it slowly started fading and i fell asleep. 

the next morning i played some video games until heard a slight ringing in my ear, and within seconds the worst anxiety i’ve had yet hit me. my thoughts felt wrong and incoherent. every thought made me more terrified of how broken my brain felt, like every synapse was firing wrong all at once. the impending doom returned (though this is the last time i ever felt it) and i was dry heaving for the next 5-10 minutes. it was this episode that marked a turning point for me. for months after this i was a complete agoraphobe. i couldn’t leave my house at ALL and on my best days i was making it across the street for a slice of pizza. i could feel my heart all the time, no matter what i was doing. i went to bed every night dreading the next day. and id wake up every morning and the first thing on my mind was how i had to get through the day again. 

i tried ativan, which worked a treat for me every now and then when i wanted to feel worry free and function as normal. i was aware of the dependency and never took enough that it was ever a problem for me, and now i have some that i bring with me everywhere for only absolute emergencies. eventually i started supplementing because of my fear of SSRI side effects, i take ashwagandha and magnesium glycinate. and it was slow, but eventually i started going farther and feeling less controlled by my anxiety. i started finding the courage for things in my life like spending time with my friends and finding love, things worth living for. 

but despite all this, i’m still not normal. i don’t feel like i could ever be “normal” again. i’ve been permanently scarred by whatever happened to me and to be frank i’m terrified that this is something i’ll have to live with for the rest of my life. my baseline of anxiety is lowered but with every occasional anxious moment where everything feels terrifying and the world feels sort of unreal, i worry that it’s all gonna come back. it never does, but i can’t help myself from thinking that the next anxiety attack i have will set everything back to how it was a year ago. 

can anybody else relate to this in any way? i know there are people who go through what i go through and much worse, but im just so utterly confused as to WHY this happened to me. 

was it drugs? i experimented very briefly with different things but i was NEVER bad to the point that i feel it should’ve caused something this severe, and i know people who have put their mind through hell and back with drugs and they always seemed to return to normality. 

was it trauma? my childhood wasn’t sunshine and rainbows but in my opinion it wasn’t abusive or scarring to the point where i even think about it at all, so it shouldn’t(?) merit something like that.

was it genetics? probably the scariest possibility of them all for me. it’s just something i can’t control because i was genetically susceptible to feeling this way. but the only person in my family who experiences extreme anxiety to this degree is my aunt. my parents are both fine, they’re understanding to what i’m going through by this point, but they can’t really fathom it themselves.","I absolutely can relate to this. Although I was a bit anxious kid, never to the point of having issues with it. I remember having something like panic attack while playing live show once (guitarist), but i shrugged it off very quickly during one song and went on. Later that evening, we had a great party and all was good. 

Then, suddenly when i turned 25, had a great job, gf, everything i could dream of - panic attack out of the blue, massive overthinking, health anxiety, all the jazz that comes with that(physical symptoms like feeling my heart skipping a beats, headaches, depersonalization/derealization, you name it). 

That was 10 years ago. I more or less successfully managed to get my anxiety under control since then, with occasional relapses but I'm working on it. Exercise, diet, sleep. 

I was like you that I couldn't figure out why it's happening to me, because there wasn't apparent reason, at least not in a sense that i had some hidden traumas (talked with therapist multiple times and we went through my whole childhood and teenage years).

So I started digging and turned out my father is suffering from overthinking and anxiety his whole life, he was even into ER multiple times (rapid heart beat, etc...) -> anxiety and never admitted that. So we had a talk. Turned out that our grandfather was suffering from anxiety for his whole life, but admitted to it only few years before he passed. Ofc he was self medicating with alcohol his whole life (I mean drinking for 60 years and living up to 80 is no mean feat. He was never drunk from what i remember, always ready, but always under the influence slightly). It was a different time and admitting to something like that wasn't easy back then. This led me to believe it can definitely be hereditary and passed onto kids from parents.  

Oh. And both my siblings are suffering from similar conditions. Also managing successfully now given we all came to realization that it's not something we brought to ourselves, but simply inherited.",1753772013.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc4ipp/a_year_later_i_still_dont_understand_why_this/,Anxiety

I am terrified and I won't be able to sleep for the next couple of nights because I am so afraid. I hate roller coasters especially and I'll seem like such an idiot compared to his baby cousins because I get so anxious and they'll want to go. I'm sitting here crying thinking about going but they didn't really put me in a position to say no.

I don't do inverted roller coasters, hate heights but all in all if you can choose not to go on those rides which no one is forcing you to it's a pretty awesome experience. || it’s not just roller coasters to me it’s a lot of the rides, any ride that can get stuck or uses a track to move it makes me so scared or rides on water scares me too — I’m afraid that I won’t be able to advocate myself without making myself look stupid || idk if this will help you feel better, but pretty much all of the slow rides have an exit for when it breaks down, usually they just let you step out and walk to the exit super easily. i’ve been to disneyland 2 times and haven’t had a single ride shut down (and i go on all the rides) and those “horrific accidents” are soooo rare. you’ll be fine. dont force yourself into anything that you dont think you can do, take it easy || i’m not scared about it shutting down I more so have a fear of getting caught in the tracks and I know that sounds stupid but I heard a lot of stories about that || thats what i meant by shutting down sorry i worded it weirdly lol. they’d just have you step out and walk out pretty easily || I mean by caught in the tracks I mean like my body",1753756306.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbzt00/irrational_fears/,Anxiety

"I’m stuck and could use some support. Injury, grief, burned out, and feeling lost","TL;DR: Grieving my dad (euthanasia, Nov '25), ended a relationship due to drug use (Jan), recently got injured (wrist + old glute issue), lost all physical outlets that gave me energy (climbing, swimming, walking, carving). Can't be the playful aunt I love to be. In the middle of a house purchase and work promotion. Stuck, drained, don’t know how to get back on my feet.

It’s not easy for me to ask for help, but dear Reddit, I think I need some.

The past year has been really tough. In November 2025, my father passed away through euthanasia after a long fight with cancer. Around the same time, I was trying to save my relationship after confronting my partner in September about his drug use (a suspicion I had been carrying for a long time). I ended the relationship this January. The damage was just too great.

Since then, it’s been a journey with ups and deep downs, but I started to feel like I was slowly crawling my way out of it. Until last week.

I’m a passionate climber. It gives me energy and purpose. Lately, I was doing really well, I swam in the sea several mornings a week, loved going for walks, and enjoyed woodworking (especially carving). But last week I injured my dominant wrist (which makes climbing, swimming, and carving off-limits), and an old glute injury flared up, making walking uncomfortable too. Suddenly, everything that gave me energy feels impossible.

On top of that, I have a maybe not-so-healthy relationship with my body and food. I eat clean and don’t binge, but food brings me comfort, and I’m scared that with this lack of movement, I’ll gain weight, lose muscle and feel even worse in my body.

I can’t be the playful, active aunt I usually am. I have a sweet nephew and niece, and I used to roughhouse with my nephew and cuddle and bottle-feed my baby niece, change diapers, the whole thing. Now I can’t do any of that in the way I love to.

I’m afraid I’m carrying trust issues into the rest of my life. After my last relationship (after all the lies and the gaslighting) I find myself more suspicious, more guarded. Not just with potential partners, but with friends, coworkers, even family. I hate that it’s changed how I look at people. I don’t want to live in defense mode, but I don’t know how to let my guard down again.

I’m also in the middle of buying a house and just got promoted at work. Which sounds great, but I’m still doing parts of my old job on top of the new responsibilities. Everything feels like too much, yet also like I’m wasting time I’ll never get back. Especially now that it’s summer in the Netherlands (a season that never lasts long).

Time with people, even loved ones, no longer brings me energy. I used to recharge with them, but now I just feel irritated and drained. It’s like I’ve run out of internal battery. At the same time, it feels like I'm letting down every person that is close to me.

I don’t know what I need to get out of this loop. I feel completely stuck, and I hope someone out there might recognize some of this and offer whatever it is I’m looking for, even if I don’t quite know what that is yet.","I hope you know how much courage it takes to write what you did. Sometimes the kindest thing we can do is lower the bar and let rest be enough. You are not behind, you are just healing at your own pace. || Holding so much at once and still being this in touch with everything says a lot about inner strength.

Nervous to start SSRIs,"Hi all,
I’ve (mid-20s female) been anxious for as long as I can remember, with its severity ebbing and flowing throughout my life. My anxiety was particularly bad during university, and afterwards got a bit better. However recently it has gotten quite bad again, and have anxiety attacks almost daily, and cry quite a lot. My anxiety is linked to the weather after having a bad leak in my flat at the start of the year (water pouring through the ceiling in multiple places) and ever since I have become obsessed with checking the weather and having panic attacks when it rains. 

Today I had a doctors appointment and was prescribed citalopram, I am really nervous to start taking them. Whilst I am open to medication, I can’t get over this fear in my head that I am ‘not anxious or depressed enough’ to start taking them. In the past some close family members have expressed that they don’t believe in taking medication for anxiety, so there is some stigma around them for me. How do you know that medication is the right choice? I guess I can always come off them if it’s not right, but what would happen if I were to take an SSRI without being ‘ill enough’?

TIA","I have horrible medication anxiety and refused medication my whole life and continue to struggle with it. I would suggest you at least try and avoid suffering for long like I did. Also look into something called exposure therapy / cognitive behavioral therapy, it’s very good for ocd and anxiety. || Don't be nervous. It will change your life. || I had sexual side effects from citalopram but other than that it was headaches. I have tried over 10 medications.


If this one doesn't work out for you, then try try again! Its worth a shot. ",1753740114.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbtt5u/nervous_to_start_ssris/,Anxiety

Why do doctors not prescribe Xanax? Im mad because my panic attack meds don't work.,Im so fucking pissed every treatment I tried does not fucking work. It's getting to the point to where  I want to get Xanax off the streets. No I'm not here to ask where to get it. I think I need to go to a mental hospital because its getting worse and worse. Some time I even wonder if I had suicidal thoughts and not realized it. I dont know what it is like having suicidal thoughts but I remember one day I was thinking man the world just sucks and I should not live. It's getting worse and worse and I dont know what to do.,"Clonazepam is less abused, has less of a rebound, and overall works better for me. I only take it for SEVERE attacks when I’m about to try to go to the hospital. Maybe your doc will prescribe it || Xanax never really worked for me since my anxiety is more generalized and constant. Klonopin’s been way more effective at keeping things level.

Edit: I am also on Prozac and Buspar. It seems to be the holy trinity for me. || Benzos are the ultimate kill switch for anxiety. Some people cant manage them correctly. Long term use comes with a long term commitment to getting off them. Take away all the other bullshit people insert in between. They dont know what's best for you, though they think they do.  || Doctors these days are afraid to prescribe benzos. I understand there are risks, a bit harsher risks than other meds, but if someone has tried multiple conventional mental health meds like Prozac or Lexapro and nothing has helped them benzos should be allowed ""long term."" That's what happened to me - tried around two dozen different mental health medications and combinations, including Spravato and off label meds and also supplements. Nothing helped. I've been prescribed Klonopin for awhile now and if it weren't for that I would be in a world of pain. I've never abused it in any way, and on top of that I don't drink or do drugs.


I'd rather have a tolerable or decent life now with Klonopin than suffer terribly every single day to the point of pure panic without it.


As for an alternative, if your anxiety is very physical you can ask for propranolol. I take Propranolol Extended Release 60mg daily now and it has helped. Also normalized my blood pressure. || It's harder to get now because a small % of people abuse it / take it recreationally and have ruined it for those who actually really need it. 
Doctors are terrified of lawsuits. || I’m the same way. Low dose Xanax got me through bad times and i never abused it. I won’t even bother now bc they just won’t give it || Because despite it working(too well,) it also comes with tons of detrimental problems. It'd be ass-backwards treatment. || Highly addictive, causes rebound anxiety, cause tolerance. Will make your anxiety worst and very quickly. || No please don’t. Trust me, anxiety ruins my life, but benzo withdrawal is the worst i ever felt in my life. || Here's the thing. Doctors have every right to be concerned about its use and potential for abuse. If anything a lot of them can argue that it actually does more harm than good. In countries like Japan it's completely illegal. Generally benzos are sort of a last resort for many doctors. They generally will try to give you other stuff and if that doesn't work.... Than maybe. || I’m a psychiatrist. People saying we avoid prescribing benzos because “some people abuse them” is true but that makes it sound like only certain people can abuse benzos. The reason there is such a high potential for abuse in benzos is because they are addictive, for anybody. Yes they work like magic in treating anxiety initially for many people, which is why they were so widely prescribed a few decades ago. 

But the problem is, when you use them daily, your body will become less sensitive to benzos. Eventually you will need more and more of them to get the same effect, and if you need to stop them for any reason, you will become much more anxious than you were before. This is especially true for benzos like alprazolam (Xanax) where the peak level is so large and quick. The risk is smaller for benzos that have a more steady blood level like clonazepam (Klonopin) but it’s definitely still there. Also, they aren’t safe for use in the elderly due to side effects (dizziness, falls, memory loss), and it’s harder to stop taking benzos after you have been on them for decades.

We have definitely gone too far in the opposite direction of where we were a few decades ago and many psychiatrists are overly cautious when prescribing benzos nowadays. But I personally pretty much never prescribe daily benzos for long-term use because I know it will harm patients more than it will help them. My rule is either long-term for occasional use or if it’s needed daily, to limit it to 1-3 months. || Sorry to hear you’re suffering right now. What have you tried so far to help besides medication? || Do you have a therapist onboard as well? It can help with the process of acquiring necessary and proper medication treatment. This is a quality of life issue, and a good psychiatrist has an obligation to help people, especially if you are resistant to the treatment given. Tell them and make them understand that you are still suffering; be the squeaky wheel. Also, change psychiatrists if necessary. There is no reason they should allow you to suffer, and ethically, they are not supposed to. I wish you the best and hope you find some relief. || You may need to get an SSRI or something longterm. Benzos are only meant to be used short term (i.e. in the throes of a panic attack). You may need to try seeing a psychiatrist - my GP will only give me 5 lorazepam at a time, but psych will give me more. || I think all the folks saying that benzos are bad are just buying in to current medical propaganda. I’ve had friends with real benzo problems, which are nasty. Even had a friend die of an overdose. However, used as a supplemental emergency med, they really can prevent a lot of misery and harm. It took me 6 tries to find an anxiety med that worked most of the time. Keep looking and don’t be afraid to switch doctors. Luckily I finally found an understanding doctor that prescribes a moderate amount of Clonazepam for emergencies. I really hate that most doctors won’t prescribe it at all. But…Xanax is some serious business. That’s a high dose that you can’t take every day without problems. Keep trying. You’ll find the right daily medication, and hopefully a doctor that will understand that those of us with anxiety will have breakthroughs that need a little extra help occasionally. || My therapist straight up told me if we ever go the meds route she will refer me to a psychiatrist. Doctors don't have the necessary training to prescribe psychiatric medications, yet they do anyway. I saw some messed up stuff working as a receptionist for a nurse practitioner's office one because they had ""one semester of psychology"". If you can afford it and insurance will cover, seek out a psychiatrist. || You would know if you had suicidal thoughts. Believe me. 

(And my doctor prescribes xanax for me.) || Xanax is a highly addictive benzo, causes gaps in memory (forgetfulness) and makes you very sleepy. Does a lot more harm than good in the wrong hands. || What meds have you tried? || I was prescribed Xanax by both my PCP and a psychiatrist. They required regular drug tests, but it wasn't a difficult prescription to get. They actually kind of pushed back when I wanted to stop taking it daily after 1.5 years.",1753657318.0,263,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb09i1/why_do_doctors_not_prescribe_xanax_im_mad_because/,Anxiety

Job interview,"I’m 18 and have my first job interview on Friday, the 1st. My anxiety is going absolutely crazy and I’m completely freaking out. I’ve already had an anxiety attack today and I’ve been crying nonstop. I’ve also been getting major hot flashes. I’m so close to just canceling the interview. I really really want this job but I don’t know what to do or how to stop overthinking. It’s on zoom and I don’t know why I’m so nervous about it. I keep trying to gaslight myself and trick my anxiety but nothing is working. Every time I think about the interview I start crying. I’m completely convinced that I’m going to mess up and get tongue tied or even cry in the interview 💔
","So heres the deal. As someone with anxiety who has done many job interviews, and who regularly represents my company as lead speaker during critical project meetings, theres three things you need to hear. 

1.) You’re Projecting- you feel like youre going to screw up, make an ass out of yourself, or completely freeze. Thats in YOUR head. Nobody elses. I cant tell you how many times ive come out of a meeting thinking “i totally fell apart in there and screwed up.” When i defbrief with my teammates after, 99/100 they didnt see it the same way. You are projecting your fears onto the opinions of the people across the table. 

Advice: do breathing exercises prior to the interview. Answer honestly and make a personal connection. Just because its an interview, dont think you have to stick to a “its all about the job” script. You want to personalize yourself. Remember, its going better irl than it is in your head. 

2.) its just an interview- you will hopefully only have to do one, but if you dont get it, you may have to do many. Absolute worst case scenario is you do freak out, you excuse yourself, and you dont get the job. Move on to the next. 

Advice- go into the interview assuming nothing. The jobs neither yours or not yours. Its a conversation amongst humans. Just talk like you would to a family member you respect. 

3.) Prepare- its a zoom interview. Which means you can prepare notes. Take notes on the company, what you want, what you hope the company provides, and three strengths and three weaknesses. Have a story about your education and experience. Be dressed nice, prep your background. 

Always remember- if it goes absolutely horrible, you met a few people who wont even remember you in a say because youre one of dozens. They wont care. Theyll only care if they consider you for the job, which means youve done well. 

It gets easier each time. The feeling never goes away. But your reaction to it changes. || Thank you!!",1753751160.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mby06y/job_interview/,Anxiety

Surgery regret over cancer risk fear!,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to make this post and see if anyone had any thoughts about this. I got my tonsils out 4 days ago. I had one tonsil bigger than the other one for years. The bigger tonsil also had a massive crypt in it that always had bits of food getting stuck after meals or had little stones daily. I would clear it out every night with a little pimple scoop tool. It would also just feel quite irritated/dry and a bit sore every other day when I swallowed. My tongue would be constantly going up there to try and feel inside the hole/soothe and dig food out etc. After 4 months of this I decided to get the tonsil out. Keep in mind it never made me very sick or get strep etc etc. It was purely those symptoms. And my other tonsil on the left looked fine and small and never gave me any issues. But people advised to just get both of them out just in case the other one got bad in the future. The ENT was also very blasé about it, saying that I could go ahead and just carry on living with it or get them out, whichever.

So I got them out and the surgery went ok. But now I am really depressed with a deep sense of dread, feeling like I made a mistake. I read a scientific study (there are actually several studies) that shows that people who have tonsillectomies have an increased risk for many cancers in the future (about 10% increased risk). I am now absolutely terrified and I keep thinking what have I done. I’ll link the study below if people want to read it. There are several but I’ll link the main big one done in Sweden. I understand that many things in life give an increased risk of cancer but I am worried that I have now added an extra increased risk onto my life. I am terrified that I have doomed myself. And I now see many people commenting online saying that tonsils are there for a reason/they’re your first line defenders and shouldn’t be removed.

This is made worse by the fact that I had asked for my big tonsil with the hole to be biopsied after the surgery due to how much bigger it is than the other one and how it was causing symptoms. But after checking with the surgeon he said that he had not sent that one for biopsy but instead sent the other tonsil (which had never bothered me), saying that the big tonsil looked fine and healthy and normal and it was the other one that he thought looked a bit inflamed. Did I get rid of a perfectly normal healthy tonsil? Should I have done this at all?? Did I make a huge mistake? I feel absolutely awful and feel like I’ve doomed myself.

"Anyone felt neck pain, pressure headaches, and doom a while after stopping antidepressants?","About 6 weeks after stopping my antidepressant (Brintellix), I started getting persistent neck pain, back-of-the-head pressure, pulsing headaches, and this weird sense of doom and hopelessness.

Also having chest tightness, dizziness, and like my body’s stuck in emergency mode — even though tests like ECG and echo are fine.

Has anyone else experienced something like this after quitting meds but after a such a long period of time? Did it go away?","Yeah I experienced something similar. Turns out the antidepressants were doing their job of preventing anxiety and reducing physical symptoms caused by anxiety, I just forgot what it was like to have my anxiety unmedicated. 

I’m not saying this is what is happening but it very well could be. Are you working with a therapist and/or psychiatrist? They would be able to better assess what this is and how to manage reducing or stopping your medication. || All physical symptoms of stress and anxiety as a result of muscle tension and tightness. || Can i dm you || Are you sure, i feel it 24/7 like someone has his hand pushing alittle its tightness/ 1-3/10 pain || Yeah",1753750260.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbxols/anyone_felt_neck_pain_pressure_headaches_and_doom/,Anxiety
I hate this. I don’t know what to do.,"I hate how an SSRI can just stop being effective. In 2019 when Effexor wasn’t working for me anymore, I had some of the worst side effects trying to come off of it. I was scared to fall asleep because I thought I would die. I was scared to be alone because I was worried something would happen and no one would be there to help me. I literally used to pace the floors at night until I was exhausted enough to fall asleep. Finally when I got on Paxil it changed and I got my life back. Fast forward 6 years i’m back in the same boat again. Every day is fight or flight. I can’t take this. I’m on the highest dose of Paxil (60mg) and I know how hard the side effects of withdrawal are so now i feel stuck on it because I am not mentally well enough to handle withdrawals. I feel like a lost cause. I don’t know what to do.",,1753763346.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc23f8/i_hate_this_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,Anxiety
Sore lungs from air hunger?,"For the past 2 weeks I’ve been having air hunger 24/7. Constantly feeling like I’m suffocating, gasping for bigger breathes, unable to fully expend my lungs it feels. I had this a few weeks ago and it went away after a while and came back of course. First time it happened I had full work ups to make sure I was medically fine, which I was. I’m trying not to let my mind spiral again. Since this morning my back is hurting really bad where my lungs are. I know lungs can’t actually hurt due to nerves, but it some why they feels sore. You know after you workout and ur muscles get sore and weak? That’s how my lungs feels for some reason. I also noticed I am taking many shallow chest breathes, then a deep breathe… sometimes I even catch myself holding my breathe. 

Could this be caused from constantly over breathing, over expanding my lungs? Has anyone else experienced this before? ",,1753762811.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mc1xhp/sore_lungs_from_air_hunger/,Anxiety

"I can't stop grieving my mother's passing, even though it hasn't happened yet.","A few days ago I watched a YouTube video. It was just some recap of a short story by Isaac asimov, called ""the last answer."" I don't know what it was, but it caused me to spiral. I'm 21 now, almost 22, and the concept of mortality finally fully hit me. I've been thinking about how old my dog is, and how she has maybe a year left. Or my mom, whos around 54, and how her time is closing in as well. I spent so much of my life resenting her for things she has done, most of which brought on by her own trauma. I feel like I've avoided loving her for so long. And now that it's processed that one day she'll leave me, and I can't stop crying. Our relationship is better now than it was, much better, but I still can't shake my guilt. I know realistically I have a long time left, and she also has a good chunk, but I can't stop thinking about the end. I can't figure out how to go back to living in the moment. I learned that time only goes by faster as you age, and I am beyond terrified. There's a pit in my chest, and the more I think about the end the more time seems to fly. This past week has felt like a blur and an eternity. I'm so young. I'm so, so young. It's not fair that I'm feeling like this. It's just not fair. In all honesty, a lobotomy sounds nice right now. 

I'm sorry for the shitty formatting, and for the rant. I think i just need to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. I find it so perplexing how flagrantly death is treated. I know it's inevitable, but the fear of losing the people I love and the possibility of not being able to say goodbye is so fucking scary. I don't even think I'm afraid of death. I'm afraid of not knowing when it'll happen. Anyways, thank you for listening. ","Anticipating grief is hard and I think we all have that realization about our loved ones that they aren’t going to live forever. 

Maybe set aside a specific time each week to spend time with your mom or come up with a list of things you want to do with her or your dog.

I think the best thing you can do is really maximize your time with your mom and your dog so someday when they do pass you’ll have no regrets. 

And don’t feel guilty, people and relationships are complicated. Just enjoy making some better memories. || This is my anxiety. My mum is the only person I have. I have children etc but it's not the same. I feel life is getting me ready for it. It's something we all have to go through. So now I'm just trying to spend more time with her. 
I think this should apply to everyone in life. We need to love more. No regrets ❤️ || Thank you, truly. I still live with her, since Yknow it's sorta impossible to be my age and have your own home rn, and I used to count the days until I could move out. But now? I couldn't be happier to be living with her.

I will absolutely be spending more time with her. We used to watch shows together all the time, and that stopped for a couple years. But you can bet we'll be spending more time together for as long as we can.

Again, thank you for your kind words. I know everything's going to be okay, I took work off and spent all day talking to her and it feels like we've made years of progress in just a day. I think everything's going to be alright, I hope the same for you as well :) || Thank you so much, I couldn't agree more. It sucks that my brain keeps trying to get me to think of whats to come, as if it expects me to be able to read the future. When I can't, it fills in the blanks, and it doesn't paint pretty pictures.

I don't think I've ever truly learned to live in the moment. I'm always stuck trying to time travel. Thank you again for your kind words, no regerts 😊💜",1753734988.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbrmby/i_cant_stop_grieving_my_mothers_passing_even/,Anxiety
Advice on stopping the worrying,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for almost 4 years now. I feel I’m doing the right things and have made progress, so I first need to highlight that. I’m not on medication, my psychiatrist stopped my lexapro dose (it was a very low dose anyway) because I have been doing better. I’m in therapy too and I really have done overall better in realizing when anxiety is coming on, acknowledging it, saying “I don’t need you right now, thanks for being there though”. 

But I have a ways to go. Currently, I find I worry a lot. I have an almost 2 year old son (I’m 32M btw), so I’m always in a constant state of awareness because, the way my therapist put it, “you’re keeping alive a human who, unknowingly, actively does things that could end his life”. I kind of chuckled at that because, well, they’re not wrong lol 

Anyway, I worry I a lot. Not just about my sons safety, but everyday things. What used to be a fun annual “boys” trip hiking is now causing me distress. We’re three weeks away from the trip this year and I’m worried I’ll have a panic attack, or just general anxiety (because it has happened before. I ran a marathon earlier in the year and was literally vomiting 48 hours prior to the race because I was so worried/anxious. I finished btw, thanks to my wife who wouldn’t let me quit when I did have a panic attack between miles 14 through 20).  

If you have any advice to combat the worrying, I won’t even use the word “stop”, just combat it it a bit, please share.

Thank you. 

Btw, I read this community and really love how open everyone is and how willing to help everyone is. I really think openness and sharing helps a ton. ","It’s not just anxiety. It’s vigilance born from love.
You’re parenting a child and your nervous system at the same time. || So sorry you feel this way. I feel your every word.

Being in the same shoes, unfortunately I can't give you any advice but I am here to listen if anyone else does 😃

Wondering, though, if your therapist mentioned other medication options or whether you'd be open to that. There are lots of kinds of meds and they all work in different ways and they're also very different for everyone.

Personally, I haven't found any meds that helped with combatting anxiety (CBT helps a tiny bit with that) but I know of other people's success stories. Might be worth discussing it with your therapist. || If your anxiety is interfering in your life, don't hestitate to go back on medication. You mentioned you worry a lot and 'fun' activities are causing you distress.  That is, to me, a bit more than mild anxiety. || I’m the same way. 😢 || I actually , just last week, asked the psychiatrist her thoughts on trying another medication. She said she doesn’t think I should do that yet because they consider my anxiety mild. She said it could end up doing more harm than good. I’ve been pushing through, for example, and she says there’s plenty of people who need medication just to get out of bed. Since I’m not there, and I don’t ever want to be, she really thinks I should keep on the therapy route and learning to manage anxiety as it is a normal human emotion. 

Side note, I did try cannabis. Oof did that have the opposite effect for me haha immediately had a panic attack. No thank you haha

Also thank you for replying and I’m sorry you’re dealing with this too. We’ll get through it. || I don’t disagree, but I’m also not a Dr so I do value their opinion. It’s relatively infrequent, too. I’ll go months without incident and then have a bad week, for example || Haha sorry about the cannabis 
I've never tried any drugs because of my anxiety - I was always extremely scared of losing control 

I'm not sure I completely agree with your psychiatrist but if you trust her completely that's good

Anxiety is a normal human emotion, yes, very important and necessary but a) only in certain situations and b) only to a certain degree. 

I can get out of bed, I am what might be called ""high functioning"" - I'm good at my job, I do well, people who don't know me closely would never know I'm struggling and yet my life is hell 99% of the time. And I most definitely need meds 🤷🏼‍♀️
I didn't take meds for a very long time either, though.

CBT just can't help me after a while, so that's why I'm stuck, too. || I think that’s where we differ, in frequency. I’ve gone months feeling great, for example. And then “out of nowhere” it’s back again for a few days to a week.",1753730186.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbphoh/advice_on_stopping_the_worrying/,Anxiety
"Obsessing over death, how can I stop this?","I am a 21 year old female and I have anxiety. I have always had anxiety but once I had my baby in 2023 it became 10x worse. I am constantly obsessing over death. I am terrified to die, I’m terrified for the people I love to die, I am terrified at the thought of death. Everyday all I think about is myself and others dying, I don’t just think about it though, I’m come up with different scenarios make myself cry and then start panicking in my head that I’ve “manifested” my loved ones (and myself) deaths and that they are going to die. It’s an endless cycle, day after day, week after week, month after month. My head just running around in circles, driving myself crazy. It’s exhausting. 
","My health OCD started after my kiddo was born. Leaving them is such a horrible thought. No advice, just understanding || I have always been very fond of this Mark Twain quote: “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” || I feel this, I am also terrified to die. But have faith, enjoy life, be healthy, do checkups. You will live a long life. Anxiety is scary but don’t let it consume you. I’ve felt like this recently but find hobbies to distract myself from sitting in my own thoughts. Don’t feed your mind to the negative I recently been off social media I feel it makes us more scared. || Oh my this is me as soon as I had my son I've been in this terrifying loop 😭 || Your brain is scanning for threats because it thinks it’s keeping you and your baby safe. But it’s overcorrecting. Those thoughts don’t predict the future, and they don’t cause anything. Obsessing doesn’t equal manifesting || Ayahuasca helped my fear of death. Maybe not for everyone. But it can show you how beautiful the other side is. Nothing to fear. || Exercise atleast 30mins a day and eventually increase it (it helps regulate our hormones). Trust me I've been there. Now I only have few episodes of anxiety unlike before, all year round😂. || this was me for a few months honestly i completely understand how you’re feeling. really the only thing i can say is it subsided over time really slowly. everyone is different but it’s good to just try to redirect your brain to something you like to do. in my case it’s playing video games. it sucks but it’s good to know you aren’t alone || Oh bless you, I am so sorry you are feeling this way. I don't know all the answers but I can try and share my experiences with you. My daughter is grown up with a family of her own now but for a few years after she was born I was obsessed that something might happen and I would leave her alone.  It could bring me to my knees at times and the best way to describe it was like having this huge umbrella over me that I couldn't put down and overshadowed everything. I am not sure when it started to get better but it did, very slowly that umbrella got a bit smaller and smaller over time. Did it start because I was so overwhelmed that I now had this little human who relied on me, was it the huge sense of responsibility of being a mum. I honestly don't know but time did help. I didn't talk about it to anyone and looking back I realize that actually maybe I should have. Now you have taken the first step by posting on here, and that took a lot of courage, to open up like you have. Well done for that. When you are ready maybe you can take the next step and speak to a doctor? But please know you are not alone, I hear your pain as will lots of others I am sure. Take care and good luck. || Sounds like ocd,mine flairs up bad when I have A baby. It eventually passes. I was obsessed with worried about my mom’s heath and fear of dying for an entire year. 
No advice, but I feel for you and it suck’s. || I’m exactly the same. It’s consuming me. || It sounds like your mind is trying to protect everyone by imagining the worst first. That’s not broken. That’s love, trapped in overdrive || You should wake up in the morning and do yoga or jogging, run, meditate, listen to music, dance, live life well, chant God's name, talk to friends and if you need support then I will support you, and I am also trying to get out of this, I believe that you will also be fine. || How you dealing every day with that amount of anxiety and having a baby? || It was the same for me too. Imagining all sorts of worst case scenarios. One time I remember we were on a drive and my husband was chatting away and I wasnt listening to a word. He asked me what I was thinking of , and I mentioned I couldnt stop thinking that my daughter was in the car seat behind in the opposite side of me (behind the driver seat) and how if something happened me and her were on opposite sides(?). Now when i think back I can see the irrationality in it. Accidents can happen in myriads of ways but to say that these kind of thoughts would occupy my mind most of the day and I would obsess over it , and then worry that my negative thinking would attract negative outcomes - it drove my crazy. I still have it sometimes but those first few years were brutal.  One main reason I am afraid of having a second one is my fear that I may not survive that kind of anxiety a second time. || Hey, I sent you a dm. || honey, your mind is against you, I'm really sorry to hear this.  
are you willing to do somework, like journaling meditating for couple of minutes and stuff so I recommend things to you?  
You need to get your control back ASAP. || It's brutal especially when you're already running low on sleep and energy from, raising an actual human. One thing that might help is not to fight the thoughts. I know that sounds backwards, but the more we try to not think about something, the louder it screams. Instead, when a thought pops up, just mentally label it like anxious death scenario. Then take a breath, and gently shift your focus to something small and grounding. || I spent years meditating (Zazen) and eventually watched The Fountain while being highly under the influence. Somewhere I just snapped and “let go”. || It’s seeming lots of people their anxiety gets worse after a baby. I think cuz now suddenly it’s not just about us but this other person who totally depends on us. I did therapy and I’m on meds so seemingly better these days. I’m also 41 so I’m always like omg I’m old now lol.

Please convince me it's NOT a brain tumor.,"I'm really struggling. I've been Dizzy, nauseous, with head and neck pain, head tremors, brain fog, episodes of sadness and more anxious than usual in the past two weeks. My headaches seem to be improving with each day, but not my tremors.

","does not sound like a brain tumor at all, sounds fairly similar to my anxiety. don’t google anything, it’ll only make you more anxious. square breathing, meditate, distract yourself with a hobby/show/movie. hope you feel better soon, you got this || Don’t read about symptoms. Distract yourself. A lot of these “symptoms” are psychological, the placebo effect is CRAZY. I noticed my “symptoms” get worse with my anxiety, so I could be totally fine but I start thinking it’s something bad and suddenly everything is worse. The brain is a fucking bitch. Go on with your day, focus on something else, like do something that requires your undivided attention, you’ll noticed that you “forgot” how you were feeling. Wait for the MRI and you’ll see it’s fine. Sometimes the symptoms aren’t even related, maybe you’re dizzy because you’re hungry, or your neck hurts because of your pillow, the brain fog could easily be the anxiety, or maybe everything is the anxiety. || I feel u gang just deep breaths and remember what u can’t control u can’t worry about (ik easier said then done) || Whatever you do don't Google your symptoms.

"Switching from Lexapro over to Pristiq, any advice/tips I should know?","Hi all, I've been dealing with anxiety and related depression since my teenage years (now 29M). It all came to a head 5 years ago where I started on Lexapro to help with worsening symptoms during Covid. The best part of the next 5 years has been normal and awesome. Yes, the lexapro made me emotionally blunt and somewhat more fatigued but I will always rather that than feeling anxious/depressed. 

However a couple of months ago, I was made redundant from work out of the blue and as much as I wanted to deny it, the anxiety and depression came back too. I've had 2 nausea/depression/anxiety episodes since that have lasted 7 days+ where I hardly eat and drink little due to nausea. I ended up going to emergency after the first one because I knew the best way to get back up and running was an IV where I didn't have to think about eating. I'm currently in the second episode now and just trying to eat where I can but it's adding to the depression. 

After multiple visits to the doctor, we've established the lexapro has worn out, exacerbated by the stressful event and have decided to switch over to the SNRI Pristiq. Has anyone made a similar swap including the tapering of Lexapro into starting Pristiq? Just looking for any help and light at the end of the tunnel that I can't see but know is there somewhere","Hi OP, I’m sorry you are going through a tough time right now. I’ve never been on Lexapro, but I was on Prozac for 10+ years and made the switch to Pristiq after taking a GeneSight test to see which medication would work best w my genes, since I was starting to have more anxiety and depression episodes. I tapered off Prozac and started small a dose of Pristiq per my doctor’s instructions. It’s been great so far, and we adjusted the doses as needed - currently I’m on 100mg daily. I have noticed that if I accidentally miss a dose, then I will get the head zaps. I never experienced that with Prozac, but I was on a smaller dose. It has helped make me super diligent in taking my medicine daily. I haven’t experienced any other side effects.

How to educate friend on anxiety?,"I got into an argument with a friend recently who told me I give “narcissism vibes” I asked them to elaborate and they said for example I get nervous going to the gym (the first few times) because I think everyone was looking at me. And then they said doesn’t that seem a little self centered?

In my mind I’m not thinking of myself better than anyone, I’ve dealt with anxiety all my life so I know the feeling of anxiousness myself but it really isn’t about other people.","I know that feeling. Back when I first got diagnosed with anxiety and told my dad about it, he said something to the effect of ""So how long before you're cured and can stop making everything about you?"" It stung, obviously, but it was also eye-opening. Some people just don't get anxiety at first, and view it as a choice, or as self-centeredness instead of self-consciousness.

The short and simple version lies in something you've already picked up on:

Narcissism and this kind of anxiety both involve being focused on how others perceive you, but the difference is in what kind of perception you're imagining. A narcissist assumes that everyone is admiring them or jealous of them. Someone with anxiety assumes everyone is judging them, or being critical.

Don't let your friend's comment get to you. These feelings are normal and valid, and honestly, good on you for going to the gym anyway despite them. That takes effort and self-awareness. I’ve had similar feelings when starting something new, and it’s never easy pushing through that discomfort.

If anything, it wasn’t a great move on your friend's part to point out something personal and frame it in a negative and inaccurate way. Now, they might not have realized how off-base they were, but that doesn’t make it any less frustrating to have it used against you in an argument.

If they are open to learning, a good starting point could be helping them understand that narcissism is based in ego, and anxiety is based in fear. As well as that you don't see this imagined attention as positive or something desirable.  

You're not a narcissist, and your anxiety isn't something to be used against you, it's just a part of being human.",1753746558.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbwbwm/how_to_educate_friend_on_anxiety/,Anxiety

WTF Is wrong with me?,"I am always - and I do mean always - perpetually late to everything. Doctor’s appointments, the dentist, social gatherings, parties, the movie theater, timed events, etc. 

Being late exacerbates my anxiety to whole different levels. I end up hyperventilating, I feel severe general panic, and I get incredibly angry at myself; I physically yell at myself and call myself all sorts of horrible things and then I tell my husband to just divorce me, that being married to me must be absolute hell and that if I could, I’d divorce myself. 

It is a horrifically vicious cycle and I find myself going through this panicked anxiety at least 3 times a week, sometimes everyday, all because I can’t seem to get myself ready to leave the house on time. 

I’m a low maintenance girl. I literally do nothing to my hair, but blow dry & brush it. My makeup routine takes exactly 8 minutes. My showers typically last around 15 minutes. Because a lot of my anxiety stems from leaving the house, I will admit that I get a stomach ache with an urgency for the restroom every day right before I shower - that can easily tack on 10-30 mins of getting ready time. But even so, anxiety fueled poo + shower, blow drying of hair, putting on lotion, doing makeup, and finding an outfit to wear… it should take me less than 90 minutes to get completely ready. So why am I always late? 

Does anyone else with anxiety have difficulty in leaving on time for things? Does anyone struggle deeply with time management? If so, have you found a way to combat this problem and arrive to appointments & social engagements on time?

I had another massive anxiety attack last night.,"Every once in a while the stress builds up and I break down. I can't help it. It happened again last night and I turned toward what is normally an outlet that makes me feel better. 

I hopped in a roleplay server for a vampire game I have, and hoped I'd have a good time. The game frustrated me to the point I left the game, uninstalled it, and left the server. 

The problem is I'm worried that my friends might think less of me now that I had another anxiety attack (it happened again just over a year ago.) 

I don't currently have a therapist, as my last one retired and I haven't been assigned a new one yet.

9 year old with anxiety? I think,"Posed this to the parenting community but it got deleted. 🙄
My almost 10 year old son is scared of everything. He’s scared of the dark, bugs, and being by himself like in his room, the car, we have to wait in the bathroom when he takes a shower. He falls asleep in our bed still and when we move him to his bed he’ll wake up in the middle of the night and run to our room. We had the door closed one time and it was kind of dark, he had what I’m assuming is a panic/anxiety attack. He was crying, sweating, shaking, saying he couldn’t see. I held him and he calmed down. Hasn’t happened since. He also cracks his fingers non stop I’m assuming when he is feeling anxious or maybe out of boredom? He also does it when he’s playing football or playing Roblox.

I’m just looking for anything that could help him. I’ve talked to his dr, but he told me that it’s a phase and he’ll outgrow it. ","I don't have a kid so I wouldn't know but I do remember what being an anxious kid felt like so it might not be just a ""phase"". 

As a kid, I wouldn't have been able to tell my parents what was wrong and I don't even think I fully realised something was wrong... But looking back, I know.

Plus also whatever your mum gut is telling you, believe it.  Take him to a child therapist - no harm in asking for an opinion. || I was like this as a kid. I have a family history of anxiety so I believe it was a nurture over nature situation. I think taking your child to a pediatric psychologist may be beneficial, I wouldn’t say this was a phase for me it is life long, but that’s not necessarily the case for your son. I wish all the best for you and your family.

Edit: grammar || Im not a parent, but wow, that sounds like me when I was around that age.
I got very anxious as soon as it was nighttime, I would get scared of being trapped in a room or any place like that, couldn’t sleep at my friend’s houses because I would cry and ask for my mom to pick my up. And I would sneak to my parents room and sleep between them.

If you can afford it, I think you should definitely take him to a psychologist and let the professional examine him.
It could be a phase of course, but those are clear signs of anxiety for whatever reason.

I hope your kiddo gets better! || I'm a parent and Mimi my granddaughter who lives with me is the same way I was a tormented child as well I suffer to this day I just turned 50 and I didn't get help til I was 16 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder ocd and social anxiety in my opinion get him some help now so he will grow up being a successful and loving person",1753734313.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbrbai/9_year_old_with_anxiety_i_think/,Anxiety

I always have anxiety before and after drinking,Every time I have a night out planned I always have the fear that I will do or say something stupid or hurtful to someone and I can’t get past this feeling. The morning after I always wake up early in a panic until I talk to someone to reassure me that I wasn’t a nuisance.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this feeling cause it would be a great help and thank you for taking the time to read my post. ,"Hey buddy, you can’t predict how others are going to see you. You can and should only just be you. I saw something the other day about presuming others are judging you … that is a story you are making up in your head, and it’s doing yourself a disservice. They might be really nice people! Assume the best, not the worst.

Also, if you are drinking with others, they will probably be just as, if not more drunk, than you — they probably won’t remember if you’re a little wild while tipsy. That’s totally normal. But if you’re worried about it, why not just limit your drinks? Alternate between alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic bevs, like soda or water or something. 

The goal is to just have a good time, be casual, and maybe chat with your friend beforehand  about the feelings you’re having. Social anxiety is suuuuuuper normal, and the new friends you are going to hang out with are probably nervous too.

Romanticizing Collapse,"I’ve started suffering from some symptoms of anxiety recently. It’s likely I’ve always had these issues buried in the background without recognizing it. There was a recent trigger event that sent me spiraling a few months ago and I now find myself digging back out.

Often I find myself thinking about what life would be like if I failed in my endeavors triggering my anxieties. If I lost the little bit of material wealth I’ve gained in 36 years, if my wife left me, lost my job and I just had to start over. Moving back in with my parents. Helping take care of them as they age and working a lower stress job into perpetuity. Not taking any new risks and simply existing in the world day to day.

I know the true me would tire of this life in short order. But the current version of me finds these thoughts comforting. Like a blanket that would allow me to rest for a while. I know I am in this project for the next 3-5 years and will not know the true outcome till the end of that time frame.

Does anyone else find comfort in thoughts like this? How do you implement structures that allow you to realize some of your current needs?","Hugely recognizable. This is a thought experiment that I have also found comforting on several occasions: if everything goes to shit, it is very likely that I’ll still be able to live a simple life with a roof over my head, enough food, books, some caring family members and a simple job. I also catch myself romanticizing this almost rustic, uncomplicated life and drawing peace from it. || Appreciate this. Imma check out the book || Exactly this. I feel like I would mourn the loss of what I have built however I know in me there is a simple person. I feel as though it is almost wrong to feel this way. || I think a big part of this is what Alain de Botton describes in his book ‘status anxiety’: our tendency to compare ourselves to others and the fear that we are not meeting society's standards for success.

Besides, put yourself in their shoes, would you be upset if someone started working and took time to learn the ropes, or would you be happy they were putting in an effort and trying their best?

Try to keep in mind that they were once in your position too, and any reasonable person would be supportive and empathetic, like you pointed out they have been. It takes time to learn anything, and so long as you're putting in a reasonable effort, they'll see that.

"Feeling like my body is telling my I am dying. Spasms, twitches, pulses","Around the beginning of the month I had a health scare which, by now, is completely resolved. However that initial scare fed into a worsening and worsening general case of health anxiety.

At first, I felt strange pulsations throughout my body randomly and seemingly out of nowhere. They were always above a vein or artery. After doing some digging I was eventually able to find this was something called a bounding pulse - an irregularly strong heartbeat feeling. 

Then that led into my limbs jerking around. My legs and arms and shoulders would be more shakey then normal. Honestly, I think it got to a point where typical, expected movements from my body alarmed me. For whatever reason, my jerks and spasms on my right side of my body would concern me much more than that happening on my left side. Today while working my upper right lip either had a spasm or a bounding pulse - I don't even know which one - which put a great amount of fear into me.

Here's some additional things about me in general to hopefully help assess:

1) I have a huge history of hypochondria and my mother does too. Bad anxiety runs in the family.

2) These spasms and pulses do not generally happen to me when I am distracted by something - mainly watching a video, talking to somebody or at rest - though my arms and legs still jerk slightly. They do happen to me during work (the only time where the lip twitch happened thus far) which might just be physical stress feeding into mental stress. Any answer to if there's a connection there would greatly please me.

3) I have no motor skill impairment aside from naturally being shakey from fear. Aside from that I do not feel abnormally weak nor am I feeling paralyzed anywhere

4) I get terrible sleep generally and I was running on only about 2 hours of sleep today at work.

5) I used to drink caffeine but I stopped at the beginning stages of my anxiety - I'd say 5 or so days ago

6) I do have an uncle with MS and I do know it is passed down genetically, however I also know it is a very rare disease ","Anxiety can definitely lead a person feeling physical symptoms. I get it because it happens to me. I am always hyper aware of my own heartbeat and that gives me anxiety. and I also have health anxiety. || i had this and it ended up being a b12 deficiency. got lots of spasms, twitches, and internal vibrations. could be that, could definitely just be anxiety, or could be something else, but imo it’s worth going to the dr for if you can || same happens with me",1753716131.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbj3u2/feeling_like_my_body_is_telling_my_i_am_dying/,Anxiety
How do leaders manage stress and avoid panic when they have so many responsibilities?,"I am just a normal salary man. Every morning I woke up feeling overwhelmed and had something close to a panic attack. It made me wonder — how do people in leadership roles, who constantly deal with high-pressure decisions and endless responsibilities, manage their stress? How do they stay calm and grounded? I struggle with stress even without those kinds of burdens, so I’m really curious how others do it.

PS. I am a Data Scientist, and I hate my job, but admittedly, I think changing my job won't change anything because I don't enjoy working. But life has no option, right?","Lots of disassociating. You can't control everything, so use your energy on what you can control. || Maybe I’m qualified to answer this question? CSO at a biotech, considerable stress, company-wide presentations, etc. Also, panic attacks starting in my late 20’s, somewhat less frequent now, but still cyclical anxiety, more winter variety than summer variety. I also have a heart condition that can strike out of nowhere, is exacerbated by stress, and makes me feel like I am dying right then and there. I’m late-40’s now.

I’ve just keep going. That’s really it. If I stop and think too big picture about my work responsibilities and what could go wrong, I want to throw up. So I don’t think about that. I’ve worked very hard over the past 20 yrs to develop a lot of strategies to deal with acute anxiety and panic attacks. But mostly I just keep going.

I’ve felt truly like I might pass out or be having a heart attack right before big presentations in front of dozens of PhD scientists lots of times. Honestly, it really sucks. I hate that part. Truly. Sometimes it’s bad - I fight the urge to run out of the room mumbling ‘I don’t feel well’ right as I’m being introduced, wondering if my heart is ACTUALLY going to stop or explode this time. I imagine myself keeling over and expiring on my way out. But somehow I fight through that panic each time.

Mostly, I just keep going.

ETA I am absolutely not a psychopath - I care about my employees and have many close work friends. I want desperately to please, which is part of the root of my anxiety. It is not the case that all leaders don’t care about wreckage in their wake. || Maybe because they make a lot of money so that counteracts the stress idk. Personally I think if I had a lot of money I wouldn’t let the stress get to me that much. Idk 🤷good question tho || I guess they’re just better at emotional regulation or generally find coping mechanisms to show composure under pressure. || Most of the time, people get into leadership positions because they want them, and this kind of goal comes with personality types that don't tend to look at themselves when things are going wrong.

My father was a business-starter and owner for many years, he worried constantly about money, about making the next payroll, about paying for that huge loan to expand the company.

But one thing he absolutely never worried about was whether or not he was right, or doing a good job, or leaving behind a trail of wreckage. He just never thought about anything along those lines, so he was mentally insulated from the insecurity around performance that this post is about.

So, to answer the question directly: They mostly never even notice it, they are too busy scheming their next conquest to worry about stuff that's behind them. || Their paycheck makes up for it. || Benzos and adderall most likely || And some are just psychopaths ofc",1753718910.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbkcpq/how_do_leaders_manage_stress_and_avoid_panic_when/,Anxiety
My anxiety just disappeared? Something feels off,"The last 2 years of my life have been tough. It started in September 2023 when my best friend horribly betrayed me, which led me to live in a terrible situation for a year. Later on in December, I started speaking to this beautiful soul, but I decided it was best to end it due to our long distance in March 2024. I didn't want her to wait. Then my grandpa passed away, right after. Then I lost one of my three jobs I worked while I was at university in April, then my other grandpa passed away in May, then my dad lost his job and all his savings. I was so behind on university work that I had to request to redo the year with no attendance without the knowledge of my parents. I suffered from panic attacks, derealization, and anxiety. I always thought I was going to get a heart attack and die; this was in my final year of university at 20 years old.

I had to move countries back to my parents, found a job, but lost it a few months later in December 2024, after my co-worker spread a false rumour about me that I stole the company's leads and gave them to another agency for my own profit. I decided to start my own company in influencer marketing SaaS, but I wasn't able to close any deals, and it's expensive to maintain. So I decided to put it on hold for the summer while I complete my university work.

I lived in a constant state of anxiety, tightness of chest, inability to breathe properly, and always worried about something.

Today, July 29th at 5 A.M, all of a sudden, I could breathe? I immediately jumped out of bed, thinking something was wrong. I could take a deep breath? My chest felt light, it felt empty, something didn't feel right. I wondered if this time, I was actually going to get a heart attack and die. I felt relaxed and calm, and something in my chest felt empty. I tried to panic, but why can't I? I was taking deep breaths, I started seeing stars, and felt lightheaded, so I stopped and sat down. I asked ChatGPT, and it told me my body just decided to feel normal after years of chronic anxiety. But why? Why now? Is this normal? I forgot what normal feels like... Something feels off, but I can't pinpoint it. Is this what normal feels like?

Can anybody relate? Why this sudden change? I still have my university work to finish, and other problems I have to worry about, so why did this happen? Is there actually something wrong with my body?",I fee t this sometimes. Then the panic attacks do return I try not to think about it and enjoy life when this happens. Like big bursts of good living worry free!! You may have processed everything enough to just be able to breath better now also. I’m glad you feel good!!!

Does anyone else have this happen?,"Hello all. Just looking for some verification that symptoms I’m having are, in fact, some kind of panic attack. 
It almost always happens when I’m relaxed. I’ll feel a weird sensation in my chest that goes through my whole body. Almost like everything in my body pauses for a millisecond. Then I can feel blood drain from my face which triggers the “something is wrong” feeling. My heart rate never goes up. If anything it might slow down. I get tightness in my chest and throat. Hyper fixate on breathing and swallowing.
This all lasts about 5 seconds and lately has been happening in little clusters of 2-3 with like 30 ish seconds between them. 
These “episodes” have become more common since they started about a year ago. Used to be once every 1-2 weeks now it’s just about daily. 
My heart was checked out. Wore a holter monitor for 5 days (of course an episode didn’t happen while it was on). Had a couple ekgs (all normal) as well as an echocardiogram (all normal).
(I also had an MRI done, all normal as well.)
I started anxiety meds which I thought helped but now I’m not so sure. 
I have had a LOT of medical issues leading to medical related PTSD. 
Over the years I’ve gotten really good at keeping myself calm after going through so much. 
I want to keep telling myself “you’re okay, it’s just anxiety” but there’s always something in the back of my mind asking “but is it though?”.
I’m just hoping someone can say “I have this exact thing happen.” Or “I know exactly what this is!.”

i did onlyfans at 18 (completely ruined my life),"im 21 now and struggle with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, anger, and so much more everyday. when i was 16/17 i got attention online for my looks and by 17 my male therapist was encouraging to pursue my “dreams” of onlyfans when i turned 18. since i was 13 i was pressured into sending nudes to guys from dating apps and got raped (both unconsentually and statutory) (same thing but yk what i mean) so many times. i did onlyfans for about two weeks the week i turned 18 and posted on twitter as well. a year ish after quitting my friend who was years older than me (and got me into sex work to begin with) encouraged me to do snapchat and twitter. i did it for a few months. i looked horrible and didnt even care to hide myself very well because of how disassociated i was from myself and my life. i talk about all of this in therapy, i try to do my best everyday. i always had dreams of being famous for my art and personality and doing social media since the youtube days and genuinely loved making videos and posting before all of this. i have so many passions i want to pursue and i feel stuck with the fear that one day if im successful it will all come crashing down from my past mistakes. my mom literally told me to my face that she failed me (she knew about all of this while it was happening). my current boyfriend has no idea and although i know he wouldn’t think less than of me if he heard my hole story, i genuinely can’t imagine telling him. my friends know and probably a lot of people that i used to know as well because it was linked to my real socials. i literally just want to die im so disgusted and no matter how much i try to give myself grace and move forward i literally just want to vomit. i had such a beautiful light and soul inside me before all of this and now i just feel like i will always fail and never be loved. i feel like i will just end up killing myself once im older. i can acknowledge that i did these things on my own but i can’t ignore that fact that my mom and older sister never tried to stop me, my male therapist was encouraging me to do it before i was of age, my boyfriend at the time wanted me to do it and helped me market it, people online encouraged me to do it, and all the men since i was in middle school who used me for my body and nudes. it’s crazy my first ever hookup was with a 34 year old man when i was 15 from a dating app. really set the tone for my whole fucking existence.  i feel like the timeline of events in my life literally make sense for this to be my reality, i just wish i could erase it all. when i remember that this all actually happened and wasn’t a horrible movie i simply can’t even fathom how pathetic my life is. i wish i could start over. im so disassociated from my past at times and sometimes i relive things i forgot about and just want to die. i have therapy tomorrow but it’s been years of this. i have no accomplishments to show, i only have a very long sad story and insane mental health issues. when is this going to end. i’m so paranoid about my future and my reputation, it feels like no matter what i work towards it will be ruined.

People are quick to take advantage of the fact that I won't stand up for myself,"It's interesting to me how quick people are to take advantage of the fact that I am shy and won't complain even if you wrong me or take advantage of me. 

I used to play basketball as a kid and I wasn't really all that comfortable with the people at the practices. When I am uncertain with people around me I tend to avoid conflict at all costs and that is a perfect environment for people to take advantage of the fact. It starts small, taking stuff from my hands or cut me in line then it turns into pushing me around and blatantly fouling me if they are about to lose etc. 
I didn't even stop playing basketball because I wasn't interested in the sport anymore(in fact I still love it and miss it), it was just that I never really got along with the people.

Another example is when I was in the army doing conscription. We had a bad leader in our group. He clearly played favorites and gave the same people the easy tasks while I and a few others who didn't complain got the shit end of the stick. He also just never listened to anything I had to say. Like I once told him I was not feeling well and that I'd like to see a field nurse, but he just completely ignored that and sent me on an attack mission, which is obviously very physically demanding.

What I learned in the army is that, the loudest people will get all the praise and respect no matter if they actually do much of anything. I feel like I was constantly criticized for things everyone did. For example the loud people constantly took breaks and stood around smoking and talking to each other, but god forbid I stand around for a second, I would instantly be assigned some shit task.

It made me happy when we left conscription and the leader of ours got bombarded with horrible feedback from everyone in our group. 

It's not like I don't notice that I am taken advantage of. The people doing it must feel very smart and/or think I am stupid, but I honestly just don't care. I guess I just don't care enough about myself to actually stand up for myself and that way cause a conflict. Only time I will stand up for myself is if I am irritated enough and then I won't do it in a very aggressive way which makes people dislike me.",,1753737141.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbsk2n/people_are_quick_to_take_advantage_of_the_fact/,Anxiety

"Anybody else still scared of getting sick from Covid-19, even 5 years later?","When I got Covid in 2022, it was horrendous. I was coughing so much that a blood vessel burst in my eye and I had to be separated from my family for over a week. I'm aware that Covid is mostly harmless now for those who get it, but I just have a genuine fear of getting it again and experiencing the same shit again.","My mom died of Covid in 2024. It’s still out there || I got it last fall and wrecked my mental health more than the other time I got it. I still don't feel quiet myself. || it's still worth avoiding || I also got Covid in 2022, I believe one of the omicron variants. I did not have full blown long covid but I swear it messed with my heart and lungs for a few months and those are things I have anxiety about. Couldn’t taste for a week after and that didn’t make me very happy. I am gonna start wearing a mask if I start hearing a lot of people coughing in my area. || I have covid currently and it has increased my anxiety significantly || It's NOT mostly harmless now for those who get it. My best friend died back in October from Covid so mild she'd tested negative for it. She was 48 years old, vaccinated and relatively healthy. (she'd also just had covid 3 months prior). The night before she died, she felt some shortness of breath and went to the ER where they gave her an inhaler and sent her home.  I encourage everyone who gets Covid to ask for Paxlovid. It literally is a lifesaver. || I’m on day 6 of covid right now, as far as I know it’s actually my first time getting it. My anxiety was stupid high for the first few days after that positive test, I anxiety’d myself into feeling so much worse. If I wasn’t so anxious it would honestly be like a cold that’s a little worse than usual. As it is, my chest still hurts from the several panic attacks I had and I’m still congested/can’t taste or smell 100%. And I’m ridiculously tired. || I've lost friends to it and have high risk family members.  Yes,  it still scares me.   || I'm a novid. To my knowledge; I have never had covid. And I worked on the covid units with covid+ patients (of course, I wore my fit-tested N95).

I still find myself wearing my N95. Especially in places that are crowded like the grocery store. It's just not worth it to me to get so sick. 

I saw some misinformation in the comments: covid is still deadly. There's a new surge that is just beginning and more patients are being hospitalized. With that, comes the deaths. Also - ideally, we should look into vaccine boosters every 6 months for optimal protection. || Covid is something to be worried about. It is disabling people regardless of comorbidities (Google long Covid), even when not killing them. I would encourage you to get yourself some well-fitted KN95s or N95s and wear them on transit, at pharmacies, and other indoor public places. Masking has helped me avoid catching covid as well as the flu, colds, etc. || My supervisor died of Covid 4 years ago. So yeah, I'm pretty scared of it. Not necessarily scared for myself, but for other more vulnerable people, like my kid. I've had it twice with mild symptoms thankfully. To be honest, I've had the flu twice in the last 5 years too and that was so much worse (for me). That being said, Covid doesn't scare me for me, but it does make me scared for those around me. || it’s literally bad for you || Covid is not mostly harmless now for those who get it. it is still harmful and terrible to get || Yeah, because I know it fucks you up. Long covid and all that. || it’s definitely not mostly harmless now, it’s just not talked about. we’re still learning more about the long term effects of it every day. and each infection increases your risk for long covid. it can still easily fuck up your entire body and life, even if you’re healthy and young

people are still dying and becoming disabled. it’s logical to be anxious, just take precautions || >Covid is mostly harmless now for those who get it,


False || Had it 3 times. First time was rough, bedridden for a few days but felt fine afterwards. 2nd time was easy, mild cold. 

3rd time was an absolute joke. My body was a WARZONE afterwards. Cuts on my face where my skin cracked, same on my lips. My throat was full of cuts and sores, I could barely breath but o2 stats were fine apparently. Skin went really dry and no amount of moisturiser helped. Eye sight went fuzzy for a few weeks after and taste and smell vanished for months. || I’ve had it so many times and as someone with asthma, yeah, it stresses me out. It’s hard for me to breathe every single time I get it. I get vaccinated every year to avoid it as much as possible. || Yes super afraid. My spouse and I have not gotten COVID. Why would I know? I test weekly and my husband had surgery to remove a lobe of his lung. I’m afraid if we get it, it’d be over for him. We mask everywhere, avoid indoor restaurants, and ask family to test. || I have had Covid twice. The first time I had it was on a Holiday weekend and I couldn’t reach the doctor until day 2 of the illness. I thought I was going to die, the coughing was so bad I couldn’t lie down. I isolated in a bedroom with my wife just bringing me what I needed to the door and leaving on a small table. We used our phones to talk. The doctor prescribed Paxlovid on day two. And on day 3 I couldn’t reach tell I was going to be fine. But the first two days I would sit in a chair next to the bed and lay my head on the bed because that was the only position I could be in and only cough every 3 minutes. 
The second time I had Covid ( self tested at home) I immediately called the doc again and again took Paxlovid. I hardly was sick at all, more like a common cold. 
Because I am older with other issues, if I get it again i hope to take Paxlovid again but the issue with that is the government was paying for it in the past and now they don’t.

"Yellow or light brown stools that stick together and sometimes float – is this normal? Also experiencing reflux, shortness of breath, and trouble swallowing.","Hi everyone,

I'm a **28-year-old woman**, I weigh **49 kg (about 108 lbs)**, and I **don’t smoke**.

For some time now, my **stools have been yellow or light brown**, and they often **stick together and sometimes float**. I already saw a **gastroenterologist**, who told me it’s normal and that I shouldn’t worry.

About **five months ago**, I had a full blood test, and everything came back normal except for slightly **elevated total bilirubin**. My gastroenterologist said it could be **Gilbert’s Syndrome**, but that it’s harmless.

Almost a month ago, I also started experiencing **reflux symptoms**, or at least that’s what it seems like. The doctor prescribed **Dsxgtrol** and **Meteospasmyl**.

Then I started noticing **shortness of breath when speaking**—not all the time, just once or twice a day. But around **four days ago**, I woke up feeling like the shortness of breath had gotten **worse**.

On top of that, I’ve been having **occasional difficulty swallowing** (**dysphagia**).

It feels like something is stuck somewhere along the path to the stomach—maybe around the spot where the **esophagus meets the stomach** (if I had to point, it would be where the neck meets the upper chest). Sometimes it feels like my **tongue doesn’t know what to do**, and I have to **force myself to swallow**.

I also get **spasms in the pit of my stomach**, and at the same time, my **throat tightens** in that same area.

The shortness of breath happens **when I exhale**, and if I try to **swallow while exhaling**, it becomes even harder.

I’ve been feeling **really anxious and scared**, afraid that I might have something serious and won’t be able to live a normal life again.

To be honest, I should mention that I can be a bit of a **hypochondriac**, and I do struggle with **anxiety**. The last **year and a half** (especially the last two years) has been **incredibly stressful** due to intense **family issues**, and I know that may be affecting me too.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Could all of this be anxiety-related, reflux-related, or should I push for more tests?

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading 🙏","Light yellow and floating means there is an increase of the fat content.  Are you becoming jaundice at all?   I’m not sure why they told you it was harmless because you have a lot of symptoms of liver disease.

You can ask for an endoscopy. || Hi, thanks for your comment. It's calmed me down a bit. My next visit to the gastroenterologist (who specializes in neurogastroenterology) will be in about a month. He told me to relax and that everything will be fine. My reflux symptoms started almost a month ago. I've already been to two general practitioners and this latest gastroenterologist, and they all tell me it's just acid reflux and that everything will be fine. He did recommend a psychiatrist. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. I moved to another city due to the same family issues (a narcissistic family). I left everything behind, even breaking off a long-term relationship about two months ago. And I'd like to mention that a year ago my paternal grandparents (who were like parents to me) died, both within three months of each other. I watched my grandmother die of liver cirrhosis, and since then I've been afraid of getting liver disease. At times, I even thought I might have contracted hepatitis C.

i think this disorder might kill me.,"i'm just so exhausted. i've been dealing with this since i was like 4 years old and im 19 now. it only gets worse. this past year has been particularly bad. my nervous system is fucked and everything even slightly scary feels like life or death. my physical and emotional reactions to things are completely out of proportion because i feel like im in fight or flight all the time. 

i can't go out, i can hardly talk to people (which especially sucks because i'm an extrovert). i can't get anything done. i can't do anything i like to do out of fear of doing it wrong. every single step i take feels like i've made the wrong choice. everything i do feels like i wasted my time. even fun activities feel pointless because im so stuck in my own head. ive been to three new countries this past year and hardly enjoyed it because i was so stressed the whole time. 

my heart races for no reason all the time. i feel like i have like cancer or something. i can barely eat anything out of fear that its contaminated or improperly cooked. i can't get a job because i always seem too nervous and scattered in interviews. i'm seriously just fucked and it feels like it will never get better.  i can't even self medicate because i'm scared that will kill me now too. i used to a lot, i don't think im allowed to share details about benzos or all that bc of the rules but it was the only thing that brought me some peace until it became unsustainable. i just dont know what else to do. nothing helps.

 i don't even know why i'm posting on here i just can't talk to my partner or family or friends because im afraid to trust them and i don't want to be a burden. does it ever get better? can i really live like this for the rest of my life?","Yes, it does get better! Sometimes it gets worse, sometimes better. I have the same issue. For example, when I was a little child with no problems at all, I lost all my eyebrows from anxiety. Now I'm 27 years old. It gets better, than you have some bad times, but then it gets better again. It's all about ups and downs and trust me, there will be ups.

My biggest recommendation is, if you can, go to a doctor to get help. There is no shame in medicines. If you can't at the moment, don't feel hopeless. We are a huge community with similar problems. My aniexty started when I was about 5,6 years old. So I had this for at least 20 years. But it wasn't constant. 

Even if it's bad now, it WILL get better. Try to find your own methods of dealing. For me, focusing on other things seems to work. For you it may be something else.

I feel sick every time im somewhere crowded,"Hello

So for context this started 2021 and at that time i was 20. This started the day i took my first vaccine for corona virus, however I do not think it has anything to do with that.

Long story short in 2021 a random day I started vomiting after I ate something, then it happened again. Because it happened so frequently I stopped eating fast food/other foods and only ate rice and bread because I was scared to vomit. At the time I thought the food I was eating was the problem because I lived my life normally, i just didn’t eat and I lost a lot of weight, but I still could go outside and etc. However now after maybe a year I started eating properly again, and then came another problem. Every time I was somewhere crowded I felt sick. First it felt like a burn in the stomach and then like a “ball” in my throat which always makes me feel like I’m about to throw up, and I realized this only happened in tight places, like in trains, bus, restaurants and any other place with some people.

3 years later I gained my weight back and more , I look better than before (I look more healthy I was very skinny) but I can absolutely not be in any of those places still, because I feel sick. I do think it’s anxiety because I’m scared of nausea and vomiting in public, however I do also feel sick late nights if I eat too much or too little or slept too little.

Also I have no problems with eating anything at home, or in some empty restaurants at day time, it’s seems however harder at night time or with many people

If anyone had this please come with suggestions for what I can do, because it kinda sucks to be that guy that always home and scared to go out

Edit: this has affected also my work and class in school because I feel sick there too and for some reason it’s when I sit down almost always, sometimes when I stand in those places it’s a little better ","Unfortunately this response won't so much help but is more to just say that you're not alone. I've been struggling with the exact same issue - I haven't been on public transport or in a restaurant in over a year now. If i'm in a queue or a car, or waiting to cross the road even I get the feeling i'll throw up.

My anxiety is ruining my dating life,"I’m not sure if this is a normal thing to feel or not. Most men make me feel so unsafe.

Need helpful advice for extreme hypochondria.,"I have trouble sleeping at night and I have a lot of anxiety during the day. 
Whenever my chest hurts or my arm or jaw I immedietally think it's a heart attack even though I am only 15 years old I know It's very unlikely. Everytime my head hurts I think I'm having a brain aneurysm or a stroke. Last night I was unable to sleep because my right leg was feeling kinda numb and I kept convincing myself I was having a stroke, I often smile on only the left side of my face randomly during the day just to make sure I am not having a stroke.

","Best advice I can give is keep yourself busy busy busy. The moment you get bored your mind wanders to the things you worry about. || hey,i am also 15 and dealing with the same but so much better now,if you want you can give me your snap or something so we can chat and i explain it to you in details how i got rid of it  || Hello, this works like addiction to seeking reassurance. The more you do it, the worse it gets. But if you manage not to, it gets better. || i've noticed that if i become anxious about certain conditions, i begin having psychosomatic symptoms- meaning my brain and nervous system create mild symptoms of that condition. i've given myself headaches, stomach pains, chest pain, numbness, and other things just by being anxious about my health. however as soon as i can tell myself the symptoms are only anxiety, they begin to go away. the only way to get rid of it is to take control and tell yourself its okay. sounds ridiculous but im serious, it worked for me. just takes practice and time to truly believe in it when you tell yourself youre fine. || Hi OP! What you’re experiencing sounds very similar to health anxiety or health OCD. it’s a constant cycle of feeling a symptom and trying to validate the symptom you’re having. For example, I often think I’m you think having a PE, so I  constantly check my O2 on my watch. Spoiler alert; I wasn’t having a PE. But it’s a rather harmful cycle bc you’re looking to disprove your panic and the more you do it, the worst it can make it. 

Talk therapy could help significantly and sometimes just identifying what’s going on with my mental has helped calm me down. Check out The Anxiety Guy on YouTube. He has some awesome resources to try when you’re in moments of panic. || Thinking you are having a heart attack or stroke are some of the most common feelings people with anxiety have... because you don't know what it would feel like to actually have one of those things, so you get to make up all the symptoms you want and fit them in to feed your anxiety.

Let me say something nearly every physician and psychiatrist has said to me and I am 3x your age... If you have to wonder if it's a heart attack or stroke... it isn't.  Period.

Now, does that STOP the thoughts? No. However, it gives me something to answer the thoughts with. So when I feel lightheaded and I wonder ""Is this the stroke"", I immediately answer the thought back by saying ""well, if I have to wonder, then it isn't it.""  When I get gas pains in my chest (which have the lovely tendency to refer pain into my arm and jaw) and I wonder, ""Is this the heart attack."", I say back as quickly as possible, ""If I have to wonder, it isn't it.""

This will not permanently stop you from having these thoughts, but it may help put some distance between the thought and the anxiety reaction. || You’re too young to have serious health issues. You need to relax || hey op!! i totally understand where you’re coming from. i have…a lot…..of mental health issues and i’ve had them for a long, long time. i have crippling anxiety (along with many, many other things) and im an extreme hypochondriac. i’m 29 and ive gone to urgent care scared i was having a heart attack. a few years ago, i went to the ER thinking i was drugged and either ODing or having a heart attack…..turns out it was a very, very severe panic attack, leading me into having panic disorder and continuing to have panic attacks (in general). i’ll feel pain in my arm and my automatic thought is a heart attack. i wish i had better advice…if any advice at all but at the very least, you aren’t alone. 

i don’t think people understand how crippling it is. especially to think you are constantly dying. just the other day, i had pain in my arm (really i think it’s pain in my shoulder from sleeping on it wrong) and it took a lot for me to convince myself i WASNT having a heart attack, instead convince myself its something much more reasonable.

like i said, i wish i had advice, but just know you aren’t alone. though i don’t go to therapy, i do believe that would be helpful. you’re young and i think it could really help. 

however, i do want to add that if this stops you from going to regular medical check ups (like annual dr appointments, dentists….just regular check ups), try your hardest to push through it. i know that’s WAY easier said than done but i had to get my tooth extracted from not going to the dentist and my first visit to the gynecologist was only a few months ago, as a 29 year old. because of my health anxiety, i was doing more damage by being scared to go rather than just going. i was lucky to not have any issues at the gyno, but i absolutely risked possible major issues because of my anxiety. i’m still working on making appointments and believe me, it’s hard. 

i’m not sure if that was helpful at all, but just know you aren’t alone in this. breathe and try not to convince yourself you are sick. || as a hypochondriac constantly diagnosing  myself with different medical conditions, is there a distinct difference between OCD vs health OCD? if you happen to know. if not, i can most definitely do my own research. i recently learned the term health anxiety as opposed to hypochondria but id be interested to know if health OCD is different. kind of the same idea of anxiety vs health anxiety || All this is from my own experiences and the small amount of searching the web that I’ve done so take it with a grain of salt but the intrusive thoughts of “oh my gosh, I have these symptoms and I must have xyz diagnosis “ and then constantly researching the diagnosis, or over analyzing the symptoms can be classified as intrusive thoughts that are common w types of OCD. I’ve heard so many terms that classify being scared of weird ailments, terminal diagnoses so I’m not well versed on the difference.",1753731733.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbq6gh/need_helpful_advice_for_extreme_hypochondria/,Anxiety
"Am I having the ""let down effect""?","For nearly a month I been having odd symptoms of allergy-like symptoms, body weakness, fatigue, etc and my sleep schedule has been completely changed beyond what I usually woke up at.

After spending 2 months on a project with friends and being stressed multiple times, I began to feel this way some days after we finally finished working on what we where doing. I usually do have allergies at this time of the year so that might be playing a role but I also feel emotionally numb and I am slightly anxious about many things. despite this my sudden tiredness and lack of motivation after all of this has made it impossible for me to feel ""fully anxious"" as I used to and stuff like my heart rate and other things feel unusually calm despite anxiety previously making everything feel like it was in overdrive.

my anxiety is getting worse,"i wouldn’t imagine my anxiety symptoms getting horribly worse in about a span of a year but i guess it has. i’m not even sure what happened to cause me to just feel like shit 24/7. it’s getting to a point where i can’t do anything, i can’t be human. i was diasgnosed with GAD last year and i’ve been taking medication to help, i don’t really see much progress though, especially now since i usually throw up every time i’m going out, i wouldn’t say it’s a body thing..my mind is just crumbling and i’m just experiencing it day by day, it’s gonna get worse and worse from here unless i try something different. i’ve tried kratom, dramamine, setraline, prozac, wellbutrin, propranolol, hydroxyzine, remeron, among many other things and it’s not working that much. i’m getting worse and worse, i’m at a point where i can’t even consider myself human. it’s hard to realize how bad it is until i actually feel how bad it is, i just want to stop i want to feel better i want to live without all this.","have you ever considered that it may be something causing the anxiety? maybe get some blood work done, a lot of deficiencies can cause anxiety. also, maybe you have a different underlying mental condition, you could be ADHD? i’m adhd and it caused me depression and anxiety and panic attacks, but it’s much more manageable on ADHD meds, which you’d think would be weird as it’s a stimulant, but it calms your mind. || I think maybe you might be using the wrong medicine. It takes some time to find the right medicine. Have you spoken with your doctor about making some changes? Ofcourse always follow professional advice. My brother had the same thing and after finding the right medicine, he was able to continue his life normally. For a while, he wasn't able to leave the house, now it has been years and he is doing so much better. || i was prescribed adderall a while ago, an ADHD test was done on me and the doctors made the conclusion that i had ADHD, i don’t take it anymore however because i had seen a psychiatrist who was very against it and took it off me. i have gotten blood tests stuff like that and the doctors tell me that i am very healthy so no i wouldn’t consider it the cause. any help for getting an adderall prescription back would be great. don’t think it’d be too hard since i was already prescribed but they would have to give me another adhd test..only issue i had was that the comedowns suck balls so bad hahaha. thanks for reminding me about that, completely forgot that i had it at some point. || ya i stopped taking adderall when i went traveling and then didnt end up taking it for like 2 years, i was distracted because i was travelling the world and stuff so i didnt have time to literally THINK, when i came home and got into a routine again, i started having daily panic attacks, anxiety ALL day and then depression to top it off. then I remembered what my life was like back when i was on adderall and was like - “oh wait i was happy and functioning back then????”

i went on vyvanse this time tho because adderall also gave me shitty comedowns where i’d get sooo tired and anxious by the late afternoon - taking vyvanse for 5 months now and it’s much better, its duration is longer and it doesn’t HIT you as hard as adderall does, it like slowly releases over an hour. your doc might approve of vyvanse more so! try to get back on them, say you’ve done a lot of research and you want to trial it for a month to see if it works! 

wishing you the best. anxiety is torture. wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. || when i was taking adderall i did notice that i was feeling way better, not sure why the psychiatrist took it off..been meaning to try to get it back anyways, i felt pretty good, for about 3 hours and then it kinda sucked lol but vyvanse is something to put some thought into, of course i would have to take another ADHD test but i feel hopeful haha..thanks! || my family doctor put me on vyvanse i didn’t need to have an ADHD test, he just asked me a few questions and trusted my personal diagnosis, gave me a trial and when i said it took my anxiety away and i felt better he kept me on them. idk where you’re from tho, im from canada, may be different elsewhere",1753731323.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbpzxo/my_anxiety_is_getting_worse/,Anxiety

Mental health court basically just took all of my medication away.,"So I got into a fight and did some stupid stuff, ended up in jail for a few months, ended up doing a plea of taking part in the mental health court program.


I've taken antidepressants and various medications for severe anxiety and depression since approximately 20 years old, I'm 32 now.

Nothing has really worked except a combination of Clonazepam and Dextroamphetamine, and these two medications gave me hope.

I also have a medical marijuana card.

Today I was told I cannot have any medications that could be considered addictive. Meaning I have to stop taking everything. I was hinted that this would happen a week or two ago and have since stopped and this is a really bad feeling.

What the actual hell!? I feel like I'm dying and it's only going to get worse. ANYBODY with advice; please help.","I think this needs more context. I work with mandated clients (individuals from jail, probation, drug court, etc.) and they often will continue to receive medication management and counseling services if they already were enrolled/engaged in treatment.

The medications you identified are indicated for anxiety and ADHD. They are helpful tools to alleviate your mental health symptoms. However, it sounds like you were assessed by a mental health professional and they deemed the medications not medically necessary? Not sure. Klonopin needs to be titrated if you’re going off of it, so I would advocate for a bridge script to help reduce the chances of any withdrawal symptoms, like seizures. Talk to your prescriber or primary doctor.

Your other medication is a stimulant and can be discontinued with minimal/no physical symptoms. You might feel “weird” but otherwise you’re medically okay. You may feel a bit more fatigued. Routine may help with this. I’m a therapist, but not your therapist.

Engage in therapy. I know this sounds condescending. I don’t think it’s fair sometimes to be told how your treatment goes. However, coping skills need to be there and reinforced with or without medications. Medications are one part of treatment. Don’t write off a therapist until you’ve built rapport. Good luck! || Is it clinical depression, or do you feel that your depression is a result of the anxiety? || If you taken these daily since 20 or a long time go to the hospital, the withdrawals from Clonazepam can literally be deadly, unless they took you off of them already when you were in jail, then just move on without out them, addictive meds will just hold you back in the long run || Thank you. My assigned therapist told me the court may or may not allow my medications. Now she said to me verbatim and any medications that are potentially addictive are not allowed... She keeps repeating the program is abstinence based and everyone has to follow the same rules. I feel like she's full of crap because she is speaking to me as if I'm a recreational drug user... Abstinence based!? Like how the hell are prescription medications breaking some abstinence rule. I find this whole situation crazy and demoralizing.

I feel like the therapist talked a bunch of crap to the court system.. she's not telling me something... The court alternatives supervisor simply told me to let her know of controlled substances that I have a prescription for and never mentioned anything about everything being disallowed... I'm going to find out what I can do in the coming days. || I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD.

The anxiety causes depression and the depression causes anxiety, for me they are both intertwined.

Right now I have a constant feeling that I can't catch my breath pretty much all day and I have zero feelings of happiness or joy, with zero motivation to do anything even things I once enjoyed. || Good idea seeking clarification about what’s expected. It can be tricky to navigate what is expected when you agree to this as part of a plea. Be mindful that you agreed to do this (as a diversion program) instead of going to jail or paying a larger fine.

The clinician may be communicating with the court or any officer affiliated with the court. Make sure you’re aware of any HIPAA (release of health information) forms you signed. If you signed a form indicating that the counselor can communicate mental health or substance use treatment information to the court, they can absolutely report any concerns they may have. Just my two cents. 

I would really encourage you to advocate for yourself as well as effectively communicate to your therapist. If you’re uncomfortable, you’re allowed to request a different provider. || Because sadly more and more just needing these medications are having people being treated like criminals..I'm on chronic pain medicine and my anxiety medicine and have been on steady doses for over a decade and now it seems there are more hoops to jump through and the hoops are higher and smaller . Smh plus companies are getting afraid to make them or they were being imported from Canada companies and are now harder to get. This whole system is broken . And people are suffering because of it. || I understand. I would not take ‘no’ for answer. Push for a review of your treatment plan with your legal team or a mental health advocate. If you’re being denied medication, document everything and explore legal options to ensure your needs are met. || I speak to a therapist as part of this program, she isn't very helpful to be honest. She states that the program is abstinence based and also stated everybody has to follow the same rules. This seems absolutely absurd to me.

My only options are asking my psychiatrist for alternatives this week during my appointment. This absolutely feels illegal and inhumane.",1753743429.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbv4ri/mental_health_court_basically_just_took_all_of_my/,Anxiety
"Please give me advice If you know about the medication, Valium 🙏","I am currently prescribed 0.5 mg Klonopin three times daily. I take this for anxiety and panic disorder... I also have back pain that bothers me so bad I can't even stand at the sink for less than 2 or 3 minutes without having to go sit down because my back hurts me that bad, so I'm prescribed muscle relaxers for it along with Gabapentin. I don't feel as if the Gabapentin or the muscle relaxer Flexeril that I have to take three times daily as well with the Gabapentin which is three times daily too The Flexeril is 10 mg and the Gabapentin is 600 mg. But as I have said I feel like they're not helping me as much as they were in the beginning, which even in the beginning they only helped a little bit not a whole lot but they helped me more than not having anything at all so I went with it. I've been doing some research and I have found a lot of post on several different apps and reviews on different apps of people saying that Valium is good for back pain, well that it's good for a muscle relaxer and it is also prescribed for anxiety. My question is this, I have extreme like really really bad extreme crippling anxiety and panic attacks everyday to the point that I cannot leave my house or go in a store or even get in a vehicle or be around people or anything without taking my Klonopin and sometimes even after taking my Klonopin I feel as if I need more because I feel as though the milligram is not what it needs to be but it helps me just enough to where I can make it through the day everyday and I can get the things done that I need to get done but I still can't get a job because I have the panic attacks I still can't go get my driver's license because I can't drive a car because I panic, I still can't go out and hang out with people or can't go to certain family functions and just things like that that matter in life and it has took a big chunk of my life away from me and I'm trying to get it back but my doctor has been stuck on only giving me the 0.5 mg and only three a day at that so you got to make what you have work you know? But for the people who have as bad of anxiety and panic disorder as I do and have taken Valium before or do take it now Can you please tell me if it's any good for anxiety and panic disorder, as in is it as good as Klonopin or better or worse? I need to know the details about this medication because I'm seriously considering asking my doctor about swapping me over to it just to get some relief for my back pain because I have to try something different because what I'm taking now is not working for me but what I'm taking for my anxiety does work some It does give me at least a little relief so I don't want to jump off of the Klonopin if the Valium isn't worth a dang and won't help for my panic disorder because I don't just have anxiety and social anxiety I had serious panic disorder and anxiety disorder. I go to my doctor appointment in the morning at 10:30 so if anyone could please comment and give me some advice on what I need to do tomorrow and ask for at my doctor appointment about this medication or give me any information on this medication I would be so so grateful and thankful as I am in desperate need of help right now, thank you for your time and God bless.

I need tips on how to stop an upcoming panic attack,"I'm 14 and getting my ears pierced this weekend, and last time I tried to get them pierced, I had a major panic attack, and literally nobody around my knew how to help. my mom doesn't even really know how to help panic attacks. so I just had to suffer through it until the person who was gonna do it just said ""you don't have to do it if you don't want to"" I really wanted to do it, but my anxiety was so high that day that I just couldn't do it. I'm hoping I can do it this time around. I also went to Claire's and since I've heard so much bad stuff about infections and stuff happening at Claire's I'm trying to convince my mom to take me to an actual place that was opened for piercings. I also think I'm gonna try to take my friend that usually helps me through panic attacks, but I don't want to have ANOTHER panic attack in front of her. Does anyone have any tips on how to calm down anxiety?","Breathing exercise don’t do shit for me when I super deep into an attack but distracting myself with music helps sometimes. I do this thing where I try to find a sound I havn’t heard before in songs I like, because there's always something you'll miss even if you've listened to it a million times. Hope that helps || Try to focus on something calming. If you focus on the thing you're afraid of, or even worry about the anxiety being a problem then you'll create anxiety. I know easier said than done but try turning the anxious feeling into excitement for getting it done. || Same thing here. Got my ears peirced at 11, I cried and had a panic attack but I got it done. Fight through the panic, once you feel that need go in, it miraculously disappears. Do you take medication? Bring your friend, I got my nose peirced last year and I brought my friend and I was only a little nervous. I think its one of those things where youre GOING to be nervous. Bring something distracting, I watched tiktok because fidget didnt do anything. Breath through your stomach not your chest, its uncomfortable but it works. || I have a few recommendations.

1) I try to have an inside conversation in my head. I know, weird, but helps. I was getting an MRI which was horrible and I was about to have the worst panic attack inside the machine. So i started having a fake ""interview"" in my head. I love history so I imagined somebody was asking me historical questions and I answered them in detail.

2) Other thing I do when I have panic attacks is to do something really challenging in my mind, to keep myself so busy that I can't focus on my panic. One of the things that I do is, I translate everything I hear to Spanish. My spanish is B1 at most, so not very good. For that reason, it is very challenging. Which helps me because I focus on this challenging activity, instead of the panic. || When I feel a panic attack coming on I eat sour candy. Sounds weird but it helps. I carry around War Heads.  || War heads!!! Also focus on something else and yes breathe deep breaths, in and out, and really focus on that.

I just kept repeating that its only gonna last for a second then I’m gonna be cool as fuck. Nothing bad will happen, especially with an ear piercing ( just remember to take care of it! ) Remember pain is temporary but swag is forever! || breathing exercises, healthy diet, physical fitness is certainly a good start. || Don't get your ears pierced. That's the easiest way. If you really insist make sure they freeze your ear real real good, and then close your eyes. || breathing exercises also don't do shit for me even when I'm not deep into an attack, but distracting with music is a really good idea || I always try to distract myself but then I get all foggy headed and can't think of anything but the thing I'm anxious about. || I do take medicine for my anxiety, but it's a long term medication and hasn't been working very well but I can't get off it bc I also have depression and I guess it kind of helps with it, but if I get off of it too soon, I'm at high risk of having suicidal thoughts, so... might have to talk to my doctor (the medicine I take is fluoxetine)  || oh, I've never thought of either of those things. I'll definitely be trying them out || huh, I've never thought about sour candy. thanks for the suggestion, I'll definitely be trying that out. may even take some to school with me for the anxious days || ya know, I've never thought of that. I might try it if I can get a hold of some warheads. but I DEFINITELY want real piercings bc clip ons hurt my ears. || That's the cycle, sadly.

"anxiety-like physical reactions to leaving my home, but mentally i feel fine?","google isn’t helping me so i need the opinions of people who know what anxiety is and if what i’m experiencing is indicative of it.

since a few months ago, i started feeling incredibly sick whenever i had to leave my house to “do a thing on my own”. usually when i have to drive to choir practice or a meeting for my future job. i‘ve been doing both a couple of times now, it’s basically routine, but my body just hates it so much.
my entire body hurts, my chest feels tight, my heart is pounding, i feel like i can’t breathe, my limbs are weak, i feel dizzy and my blood pressure shoots up (to like 140/90 when my usual resting bp is 100/70). i get chest tightness when i‘m “regular nervous” too and this very much feels like a “nervous but dial it up to 1000”.
this all sounds incredibly like anxiety to me, or a panic attack or SOMETHING, except for the fact that mentally i feel completely fine! the most prominent emotion i feel by now is annoyance at my body absolutely shitting itself just because i need to be somewhere!!
the first time this happened i had to stay home because for the entire hour before leaving i was feeling like this when it had never happened before. 5 mins after it was decided i would stay home, the symptoms went away.
i would really appreciate if you guys could share if you’ve experienced this before, or if you think it sounds like something other than anxiety.

Taking propranolol..,"Hi there. I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder.

I’m debating whether to actually take it. But I don’t know. I’ve been given 10mg tablets but I’ve only taken one instead of two as told to.

I need help,"i’m reaching my limit of how much pain and anxiety i can take. it’s been days now of unending, crippling anxiety. if i think about it, i panic and cry. and if i can’t get that under control, i start to hyperventilate and will have a panic attack. my anxiety makes my chest hurt, my stomach tighten up, makes my whole torso feel cold, i get shivers, tingles, it gives me headaches. i can barely eat. showering requires me to be alone with my thoughts for too long and it puts me right back into that panic spiral when im in the quiet. i am scared, im more depressed than i have felt in a very long time, and all of that anxiety is felt in full force by my body. i have such severe psychosomatic symptoms that i thought i was sick a few months ago, but it really was just anxiety. no medication helped, it was just weeks of nausea and vomiting and no sleep. i do not want to live like this anymore.

i am in therapy, but it is very new to me. i am speaking to a psychiatrist soon but everything medical is slow and i feel this way every waking second of the day while i wait to be seen by a professional. i’m not bottling it up so much anymore, im talking to friends and family about it even if it makes me cry. i’m crying when i need to. the things that i am worried about are life choices that i made myself. i am moving away from home for the first time soon and i feel like i am going to die if i do. it’s what i want, to live in another city and go to this new school. but leaving my family and my dogs is too much for my heart to take. i’m sensitive. i can’t be alone for very long, and i only ever have felt comfortable around a very select few people. i really truly cannot imagine a life that i can live where im happy, and im just so so tired of being depressed and anxious. i freeze up when im scared or anxious, and when im stuck in these cycles of endless intense anxiety, i feel like im in full fight or flight and i just can’t move. usually doomscrolling would be my first response to that but social media has only been making me feel worse, so i can’t even do that. i just sit there and breathe and think about how i feel like there’s never gonna be a life where im happy.

what can i do? i feel stuck. i am moving in about a month, and school doesn’t start for about 2. i am currently unable to work because im recovering from surgery (another extremely giant stressor that is frying my nerves, though i am past the hard parts of that). i worry about so much. money, work, moving, school, my career, losing people. sometimes i just worry. about stuff that’s so far in the future it’s over half my life away. i just can’t take it. i want to turn my brain off. i don’t want the waiting to be so bad, because no matter what, im doing this. 

","First of all I didn’t breathe while I read this and I don’t believe you did while you wrote it 😅 . First thing you need to do is breatheeeeee !! Anxiety can not and will not kill you or make you go mad. It is your sympathetic nervous system in absolute overdrive. You need to activate your parasympathetic nervous system to counteract.

24f anxiety taking over my life,"Hi everyone this month has been difficult for me. I feel like on paper I should be the type of person that has nothing to worry about. Two loving parents, close sister, amazing bf, living in my dream city. 

My anxiety had consumed me for a month now and I have been a shell of a person since then. I’m making a huge life move abroad with my boyfriend and I quit my job. 

I’m in therapy again and I’ve been taking my meds. But in the month of July I had 4 sleepless nights out of major anxiety. I can’t even count the attacks 

The worst was this weekend at my sisters engagement party. My meds interacted negatively with alcohol consumption and I was belligerent and yelling and crying. 

The anxiety attack was so severe I punched my legs until they’re bruised and I hit myself in the face. My legs are severely bruised and hurt so bad. My head hurts and I have slight bruising. I’m so ashamed and I feel like I’m at my lowest. 

Anything helps. I feel like no one understands me. ","Hello, sorry you're going through that, it sounds really severe. 

What meds are you taking?

How do I stop feeling insecure about my friendships?,"I have never been good at making or keeping friends as I am on the spectrum and now I often get anxiety attacks because I feel like a bad friend.

This is probably mostly in my head, but especially when my friends hang out with their other (closer) friends I get anxious and insecure and it makes me mad at myself, because I hate feeling sorry for myself, it makes me spiral and I start obsessing over thoughts that my friends only hang out with me out of pity.

I feel like a bad friend because I might unconsciously put up a wall, I am present for ups and downs and even casual conversation, but I feel like I’m not doing as much as a friend should be doing, if that makes sense.
Maybe I need to start texting daily, but that’s where my anxiety starts kicking in.

I feel like I am always intrusive and like I am forcing myself into a friend group or the person who I want to be friends with sees me as a try hard and and thinks I’m annoying. I feel stuck because I feel bad for trying and not trying.

Looking at my history of friendships, I have never had a best friend, not even as a child, I was often bullied and left out by my friends and I have been the floater friend in any group.

I know my current friends don’t actually think any of this (in fact it makes me feel even more ashamed because I am essentially blaming them for my own insecurity) but my brain ruins my whole day if I even see a picture of my friends hanging out or them just talking about doing something, and I’m missing out, not even because I want to be invited to everything because I’m rational and I know that’s not possible, but even if I was on the other side of the world and there was no way of me being physically there I would still feel anxious that I’m doing something wrong.


Does anyone have any advice to stop or handle these thoughts? 
","I recommend the radical acceptance technique. Are you familiar with it? || I am not, could you explain it to me? || It's very simple. You must first of all not reassure yourself how what you're afraid of isn't going to happen nor try to figure out how likely it is to happen. And the acceptance itself is simply telling yourself how what you're afraid of might indeed happen or might be true. And add how if it happens or if it's true, it's fine. In the tone as if you don't care, as if it's not a big deal. No matter how terrible it would actually be. And always end thinking about it on that note.

The way this works is, reassurance keeps worrying coming back, which it must be avoided. The acceptance makes the fear of from the worry lose power.

Also you must not try to shake off the feeling of anxiety. Letting it come and stay. || Thank you so much, I will definitely look into that and how to practice it 🙏🏼 || No problem. It's part of DBT, so try looking that up.",1753725511.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbnd1y/how_do_i_stop_feeling_insecure_about_my/,Anxiety
More than one benzo?,"Me again lol I have Ativan and Klonopin and I’m gonna be honest. Ativan works great for panic attacks and Klonopin works great for physical anxiety ridden days where I needed to last all day and all night my question is I’m going on a huge trip next week and I am already fired up about that because of physical things  I fell and am I’m scared about. 
 so today I’m trying Klonopin ( first time I tried it and the only other time. I thought it worked great today. I’m unsure which is weird..)  and is it OK to try Ativan tomorrow to see which one I prefer for my trip ??
I’m not sure if you can take one after another. I know Klonopin is less addictive according to my psychiatrist and he said try to use that one if I have to, but if I need to use Ativan, I can I just cannot use them in the same day or drink or drive with them however I don’t know how many days apart I should be doing that as well please keep in mind. 
This is just to get me through a really huge trip while I am adjusting to different medication‘s and I am new to benzos and have no plan to take them forever, but I have to get through this trip and have the most fun and not be in my head 
But I also don’t wanna test them too close together but I leave Monday so the clock is ticking lol hopefully this makes sense thank you in advance. Just not sure if anyone else has more than one benzo and you take a different ones for different situations and how often you do it.
I also have hydroxyzine which helps me sleep, but definitely does not help my lightheadedness, which is one of my biggest physical symptoms that fires up my mental symptoms and I don’t know if any medicine will help the actual head feeling but if it helps me get out of my head about it that’s enough . It’s also weird because last time I don’t remember it making me feel tired and today I feel tired, but it could be because I tried weed last night which is a no-no for me. I did not enjoy that for my anxiety.
PS Sun say tried to Klonopin every single day, but I don’t wanna become used to it and not work next week for my trip and either one might always make me tired and feel off. I don’t know sometimes they do that and sometimes they don’t. It’s weird. ",,1753738497.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbt4m2/more_than_one_benzo/,Anxiety

I have irrational fears and they are slowly taking over my life.,"Trigger warnings: non-ed related food issues, vomiting, alcohol mentioned, physical anxiety 

I have irrational fears and right now, I feel like they are limiting me more and more. 

First up, my newest fear has developed over a longer period of time and two days ago it significantly worsened. The past few weeks/months I noticed that I had a lot of anxiety around overeating. Not because of calories/body image, I love my body and if anything, I am too skinny, so it isn't based on that. Rather, it's about a fear of nausea/vomiting, like, I'm scared I'll be nauseous or I might have to throw up if I eat to much. It also isn't the vomiting itself, which I don't find very scary or anything more than slightly uncomfortable, it's rather the thought/ the repercussions of having to puke in front of others without a toilet or bucket near. It's also connected to a fear of not being able to finish my plate and being impolite. I am too scared to admit I'm full or not very hungry, but if I feel like I will have to overeat, I immediately get nauseous from anxiety alone. 

Last Saturday, my fear worsened a lot. I was at a small birthday gathering with like four friends of mine and there was cake. I don't really like cake in general, but deeply dislike cake with buttercream and mousse and everything. That cake had everything I dislike, but I was too polite to say no and my friend gave me quite a big piece. I started eating and got over halfway through, taking small breaks and gossiping, but at that point anxiety kept me from eating anymore due to unbearable nausea (I guess I didn't take having to eat a food I hate all too well). I waited and was fully prepared to politely explain I still wanted to keep some space for the pizza we'd make later, but my friends stayed at the table even after having finished  their respective pieces of cake, waiting for me to finish mine. I fought and after an hour, I had finally eaten it, but after, I was nauseous and only ate a single slice of pizza because every food I'd eat after the cake made me slightly nauseous and the taste of the cake lingered. 

When I got home, it was okay at first, but laying in bed, the taste started kind of haunting me and that alone made me nauseous. I started worrying that something was wrong with the cake or its ingredients or maybe with the pina colada I was served. I felt terrible and couldn't sleep for hours because of my anxiety. No matter what I ate or drank, the taste of the butter cream stayed in my mouth. 

Now, I don't only experience anxiety because of the overeating/not finishing my plate/vomiting thing, but I also can't eat anything not made by myself, my relatives (because I know everybody in my family cares about expiration dates and keeping stuff in the fridge at all times) or restaurants (because they are forced to clean everything all the time and only use ingredients they are 100% sure are safe to eat). 

Is that related to emetophobia in some way? Or just plain anxiety? Does anybody perhaps know how I can deal with all of this? I feel like it limits me in what I can do without worrying and I tend to avoid situations that give me anxiety, but I don't want to let anxiety control me. ","Sounds like bad anxiety and phobia. Maybe some kind of obsession and I want to tell you that my mind also has its „fav anxiety topic”. Of course, I also suffer extremely irrational fears and whole scenarios since I was a little girl. This thing has stolen all my life and my light and my childhood. I also have hipochondria and many more. I have been tested for a lot of mental illnesses and this whole shit is just „anxiety”. Now I’m taking meds and going to therapy. I have found that actively working on my fears with my CBT therapist is helping me but I have violent ups and downs.

Waves of chest pains,"Starting in 2019, I started getting chest pains as soon as I laid down for bed. They come in periods—every couple seconds it feels like a wave of tightness hitting my chest. My throat gets hot and tight, my chest hurts so bad, and I feel like I need to yell when I exhale for even an ounce of relief. Next 10 seconds, it’s gone. 10 seconds after that, another wave of pain comes. About 50 cycles of this and I just knock myself out with melatonin because breathing exercises and antacids don’t work. I’ve gotten EKGs and blood work done for this, but everything is normal, and the doctor just chalks it up to anxiety. This stopped around 2023 after I got on Zoloft and moved to a new house, but for the first time in years, I’m experiencing it again. A lot of posts I see on here don’t really describe “waves” of agonizing pain but rather a constant tightness.

Anxiety/panic attacks related to grieving. What physical symptoms do you have? How long did it take for them to go away?,"I’m currently dealing with this and just trying to find some hope that this will pass eventually. It has caused me to be too fixated on my health due to all the different things I feel. 3 weeks and counting. 
","I lost my job back in December and have had 24/7 muscle tension that starts sometimes immediately when I wake up or within a minute and sometimes just losing my breathe randomly throughout the day as my body is in a flight or fight mode so it makes sense it needs to burn off the energy at certain points of the day. Also ringing in ears.

My social worker told me to meditate 3 times a day, 20m morning, lunch, and before bed and it takes 10 weeks to rewire your brain. 

Meditation trains your brain to be present, in the moment and trains your brain not to pay attention to those physical symptoms so your body will eventually give up because you aren’t re-enforcing the physical symptoms because the brain things something is actually wrong and when you focus on it or think about it it can keep you in the loop longer.

Some people do the medication route which I’m not doing. I just quit caffeine, go to bed at a decent time every night, and do my meditation and I’d say I feel like 50% better after 3 weeks.

Get yourself physically checked and maybe see someone to help you process this in a healthy way. I’m sorry. It must be really hard but just remember it doesn’t last forever and you will get better. Even though it feels like it never will. || I’m sorry to hear about losing your job.. were you able to find a new one? and I appreciate you for the insight! Yeah it’s been rough. To add on to that, I haven’t been getting good sleep due to having a baby who’s teething. So I’m lucky if I get 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

Yes I found a new job within a few weeks but doesn’t help the fact that I didn’t have the tools back then so I was suffering for a few months before I gave in and saw a social worker.

Anxiety and addiction,"I have had anxiety my whole life.  All of those ""stomach aches"" in elementary school were manifestations of anxiety, I am learning now.

I need help with a mental problem,"NOTE: I put my initial message into chatGPT to shorten it and make it sound more literate, all the content is the same but it’s just written better.

I’m a 16-year-old guy dealing with a strange mental issue that’s been bothering me for a couple of months. I’ve always been a bit anxious, with some mild hypochondria — like worrying I had cancer because of bumps in my mouth, or thinking I’d get a brain-eating amoeba from snorting water from a bottle cap. I tend to fixate on things like this for a short time, then move on.

This recent issue started during a break in the middle of my GCSE exams. I woke up one morning with a weird, abstract feeling — not sadness exactly, but something that made me feel mentally off, like something wasn’t right. It lasted a couple of days, then I brushed it off and felt okay again.

But then I started experiencing shallow breathing, which lasted about a week. After that passed, the weird feeling came back — and this time, it hasn’t left. It’s been over two months now. The feeling is hard to describe. It’s like a mental “cloud” that dulls everything slightly and sometimes makes me feel disconnected from myself, like I’m just going through the motions rather than actually living. I still enjoy things, but this feeling sits in the background constantly, and at times it gets really overwhelming.

What’s strange is that it fluctuates — sometimes I feel mostly fine for a few days, then suddenly it hits hard again. It’s not depression, and I’m not having dark thoughts, but it makes me feel emotionally flat and like nothing really matters.

I’ve come up with a couple of theories. One is that the sudden shift from being busy and anxious during exam season to suddenly having nothing to do triggered it. My brain might be so used to staying active and stressed that it’s now creating this sensation out of boredom. This would explain why I feel better when I’m doing something engaging, like playing guitar or watching a movie.

Another theory is that I’m subconsciously stressed or upset about finishing secondary school. It was a place I got used to over five years, and now that I’m moving on to college and facing the unknown, maybe my brain is reacting with this weird emotional response.

Whatever the cause, I just want this to stop. It’s draining. Some days it’s very minimal but it’s always there in the back of my mind. I’ve never had anything like this last this long, and I’m starting to feel pretty stuck.",,1753735716.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbrxng/i_need_help_with_a_mental_problem/,Anxiety

I was more scared of the wisdom teeth pain than the anesthesia || I have a much better experience with the dentist than I do with doctors because most of my past dentists have been fairly kind and understanding. That being said, I still get somewhat nervous with them because my family has a history of bad teeth. I always make sure that I buy myself some sort of prize after the appointment kind of like a ""I was brave.""

I waited until I had to get my wisdom teeth out and wisdom teeth pain sucked. I had 2 impacted teeth and one was starting to press on my nerve. The anesthesia depends on the person.

I have an absolutely debilitating fear of needles and was given Alpraz*lam for a blood draw I need. Need advice.,"Sorry for the long title, and it kinda speaks for itself. I have to get my blood drawn to continue a critical antipsychotic I take, and I am so unbelievably fearful of getting my blood drawn or shots in general. My doc prescribed me a 1x prescription of Alpraz*lam (sorry for the censoring, I’m not entirely sure if I’m allowed to say the real thing) to get through the experience. 

I’ve never taken it before and I just want some reassurance about what it might be like? How long will it last? I also smoke weed for anxiety, and though it’s supposed to help, it sometimes can exacerbate the anxiety, rather than quell it; is that a potential with the one I will be taking? Could it make me super nauseous? Will I be hungry? How do I know it will make me feel better? 

I am going on Wednesday morning and am so so so so stressed about it. I’m trying to tell myself the medication will totally help me and i’ll be good. I also got lidocaine cream to assist with the pain though I know that won’t be foolproof. I just need some type of reassurance about the medication as well as the “procedure”.","Xanax does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Take that feeling of fear, anxiousness, etc feeling away. That’s the “high” people get because it removes all those worries away. And it’s also why it’s abused. When you can go from crippling anxiety that makes you feel crazy to a regular person that can live day to day life it’s great. || Get someone to drive you though. You should take .25-.5 mg an hour before. That’s going to make you want to sleep afterwards. || I can ONLY speak for myself since it has slightly different effects on everyone. Some people get tired.. I don't, it wakes me up.

However, I am going to way back in time to one of the first times I took it to explain what you may experience. I NEVER liked flying and I had to fly across the country a few times a year and I dreaded them. Doctor gave me a Xanax prescription.  

I got on a flight and was feeling particularly stressed, so I took it.

When it was time to land, the plane had to fly through a thunderstorm, which was pretty much my worst nightmare. It didn't even OCCUR to me to be afraid... I decided to grab my bag and look for my camera so I could get pictures of the lightening. In that moment as I am sitting there with my camera looking out the window of the plane hoping to see a bolt of lightening I could get a picture of I thought, I realized what I was doing and thought.. ""HOLY CRAP.. THIS STUFF WORKS.""

Another time I had to fly into Los Angeles during a wildfire and I did NOT want to leave for the airport. I took a Xanax and by the time I got to the airport, I was talking and joking around with everyone without a care in the world.

It shuts off the anxiety like a switch.

You may feel tired after the appointment, b/c it will work to quell the anxiety you are feeling, but once the appointment is over and there is no more anxiety, you will just feel tired, so I HIGHLY recommend having someone else drive or use UBER/Taxi.  That never happened with me... I actually ended up with more energy but that was because I had a undiagnosed anxiety condition at that time and since Xanax took the anxiety away, it ended up waking me up.

As for the procedure itself... for what it is worth, when it is done, you will wonder why you were so worried about it. It hurts way less than a papercut and the pain is gone within milliseconds. I know that doesn't really help... my kid is also terrified of needles and we had to go through all types of things for his vaccinations... after he always had to admit it wasn't even 1% as bad as he thought it was going to be, but we had to deal with it again the next time. || you’ve never felt nauseous on it? || thank you sm for the instructions i def didnt know when i should dose up || thank you for this. my mom will be coming to get me yeah. i know every time i get a needle it’s always alright, and im just trying to remind myself literally 10 mins after its done i wont even be thinking about it anymore. 

you’ve never run into it making you nauseous? i’m honestly not worried about throwing up, obviously would prefer to as normal as possible tho || No not nauseous. || It might be worth asking your doctor if you can have a 2x prescription to try it beforehand.


It does exactly what it's supposed to do with basically nothing else.


You'll be the chillest you can ever think of and remember a time when you were so worried, that seems very distant. You'll be able to communicate so you can tell people what you need.


I can assure you that the process itself of having blood work done is not bad, I really dislike needles and get moderately upset any time something involving them happens. I intimately understand the psychological aspect of being extremely intimidated by things that should normally be very manageable. All that will happen is that the psychological aspect will fade in an almost unbelievable way and the situation will truly reveal itself for what it is, not so bad. I promise you you will walk away from this situation thinking that and the psychological anticipatory fear was, by far, the worst part.


And no, never nauseous. If I had to describe anything at all it's the the feeling of being calm feels slightly foreign (but good.) || Xanax has never made me nauseous. Anxiety certainly has.. if anything Xanax would take the nausea away.

Again, the big disclaimer is that each of the benzos work slightly differently for everyone. I've never met someone who had nausea as a side effect, but I don't want to make some guarantee. || yeah yeah of course. i appreciate it so much 😭😭 || Something I would like you to do this time.  Bring your phone with you... after you are done, make a video just for yourself and explain EXACTLY how you feel after it is all done. Explain exactly what you though it was going to be like and what it was actually like. Go into detail. Save that for yourself so in the future, you can watch it and it may help reduce initial anxiety. || i will, this sounds very helpful as well. i just can’t wait to get it over with",1753721251.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mblew9/i_have_an_absolutely_debilitating_fear_of_needles/,Anxiety

New persistent anxiety trigger.,"My anxiety recovery journey has felt like a ride on a sawtooth shaped roller coaster, every bit of improvement seems to come crashing down with some new problem that I obsess and get very fearful over.

I recently upped my dose of Duloxetine from 20 to 40 mg each day (I take one 20mg pill in the morning and one in the evening). After having a massive panic attack about memory and forgetfulness.

Things seemed to be improving until Saturday night when I started noticing a strange smell.  Thought it was a sign I was getting a cold, but nothing else has developed since.  I’m now terrified that it’s the meds that are giving me a phantom scent that comes and goes by the minute.  I haven’t had quite as strong a panic attack about this as I guess the meds are doing their job to some extent, but every time I get that weird unpleasant scent  in the back of my nose I get a little unnerved again.  Sometimes getting chills and sweating as well.

I’m scared that this is now my life for as long as I can stand it.  A perpetual moderate anxiety attack that I can’t calm down from or alleviate the source of.  I’d appreciate any advice or thoughts about dealing with this kind of anxiety. ",,1753734573.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbrfi9/new_persistent_anxiety_trigger/,Anxiety
Recovery from the crash; how long will it take?,"For about 17 days on and off, I (15M) experienced anxiety regarding my health. If my heart started to beat just a little bit fast, I'd go right into fight or flight mode. In the past week, it accelerated to the point where I frequently experienced bouts of lightheadedness and tension headaches on a daily basis. I'd go to sleep worrying that I wouldn't wake up in the morning, then nothing would happen, but the cycle would repeat the very next day. Today, though, I've spoken with my grandmother, and her words have really de-escalated my stress, even more so than the advice of two different doctors. After researching my symptoms extensively with the aid of ChatGPT, I've realized that I am now in a post-anxiety crash phase, where I'll likely feel off still as my anxiety lingers and tries to take back control of my brain. I'm glad that I don't think I'm dying anymore, but the process of recovery hasn't been too pleasant so far. I'm sure that lots of people on this subreddit have gone through the same crash that I have, and to those people, I ask: how long did it take you, and how long *could* it take me, based on what I've said in this post?",,1753733942.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbr59e/recovery_from_the_crash_how_long_will_it_take/,Anxiety

Can anyone help me climb out of this hole I'm trapped in?,"Been in a state of hyperarousal for 3 months due to severe anxiety having all these intrusive OCD thoughts that there is something medically and mentally wrong. Its gotten to a point where its caused chronic insomnia yet feel wide awake all day, and whenever I get real tired its perceived as a threat as is sleep as I get massive panic attacks. I've been inpatient and now outpatient and still trapped. I get massive long lasting panic attacks all day, am on multiple meds.

The fear of being tired happens automatically when I feel tired and get thoughts like am I going to collapse, am I going to die, am I going to knock over or break a device again. As I passed out one night and my Nintendo Switch was on the floor and I'm the type to drop devices. I have been losing memory of when I sleep the last few weeks and most of the night but wake up shortly and can't get back to sleep due to the panic attack.

The outpatient wants to move me to a exposure part of their program as soon as a spots ready, I get waken up by jolts of panic/anxiety any time I try to sleep. Is there anyway to reprogram my thinking on this and to expose myself? I don't want this to go on any longer, been the worst suffering of my life its been a horrendous past 3 months. I'm very sensitive to bodily sensations so feeling tired or relaxed is an automatic anxiety trigger when I wish it weren't any longer. Idk if this can naturally end on its own or be stuck permanently I'm terrified. ","Reprogramming doesn’t start with action.
It starts with allowing your question to stay unanswered without panic.
That’s already a different system speaking || Could you explain more on that? I found this and turned it into my own version not sure if its helpful,''Maybe I will collapse, die, or harm a device while being tired. Its very unlikely but the chance is always there, and there is no way around that.''

So I can accept the unknown/uncertainty. Not sure if that's good for this situation.

How about though automatically feeling panic when I'm tired that perks me back to a wide awake state though? How do I overcome that? I've talked to and seen many medical professionals and feel like I'm at a loss while suffering, was praying for a long time but gave up on it I want to go back, and the other thing is I fixate and over ruminate on these excessive tired to wide awake states. I want to focus on the happy and let it be. || I dont have answers - but let me be clear on what I hear from you.
That sentence you wrote Maybe I will collapse, ….. -that’s not giving up.

That’s you learning how to stay with fear without running from it.

You’re not trying to erase the danger anymore.
You’re learning to live with the possibility and that’s a huge shift.

The panic when you get tired?
It’s not weakness.
It’s your body still thinking it has to protect everything, all the time.
Even resting feels unsafe like you’re dropping the guard.

But the fact that you can say “maybe it happens… and I’ll still be here- that’s not collapse.
That’s your mind practicing a new kind of safety.

And that last part you wrote 
“I want to focus on the happy ” 
that’s not just hope.
That’s something in you still reaching forward, even now.

You’re not stuck.
You’re shifting slowly, in a way your panic can’t see yet.

Potential medication switch,"Hi all, I haven’t posted here before so I’m hoping this is allowed. 

I’ve suffered with anxiety all my life (24F, in the UK) and in March this year I finally got over my fear of anxiety medications and started taking propranolol (40mg twice a day). This made sense at the time as my anxiety was mainly physical - I can get the mental side under control but the nausea and heart palpitations will last hours if not days. I do have some mysterious stomach issues (they’re finally investigating thank god) which means I am nauseous a LOT and that then triggers the anxiety, which makes me nauseous, which triggers… you get the picture. Just to confirm, my doctors have said that there is something physically wrong with my stomach - it’s not just anxiety triggering it - they’re just not sure what.

I feel like while they worked great at the start, I need something now that does target the mental side a bit more as I’ve been feeling worse. However I’m keen not to go on SSRIs as I don’t know a single person who has liked being on them, and with my terrible gastric issues I need something that is less likely to give me terrible physical side effects for the first week/month/whole time etc because they will trigger a flare up and I’ll be out of commission for weeks. I know we aren’t supposed to peddle meds here but can people give me an idea of what they’ve used and if it’s been relatively painless (metaphorically speaking)? I’ve done bits of research but everything just talks about sertraline etc and I’d like them to be a last resort.

Scared to take buspar,"I've been getting treatment for GAD. I'm currently taking mirtazapine every night and my doctor recently gave me buspar too but I've been too scared to take it. 

I did the bad and googled side effects. I'm scared of serotonin syndrome and I've seen a lot of people complain about dizziness.

If anyone has any reassurances to offer, I'd greatly appreciate it.","I’ve been talking Buspar for about 20 years and haven’t noticed any side effects. I can’t remember if there were any at the start that went away, but obviously nothing so bad that I stopped taking it. Take it slow and good luck! || Buspar is a wonderful therapy!  I take the max dose, 60mg a day, and I break the pills into 4 15mg doses throughout the day. It's subtle, and takes 3-4 weeks to really get going.    
I have had 0.0 side effects, and here is a real booster.....the generic is  cheap and lasts all day.  
I take a whopping 100mg of atomoxetine for ADHD, and that drug is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which is supposed to increase the effects of buspar.    
I still have no problems to date. || I am on both mirtazapine and buspar. The “worst” side effect I get from it is restless leg syndrome. I’m also on bupropion, sertraline, and zofran and I don’t have/have never gotten seratonin syndrome. I’d just give it a try! Seratonin syndrome also goes away as soon as you stop taking the offending medication, so if you find yourself having weird side effects, contact your doctor and discontinue use. || Bruspar didn't do anything for me either way. I took it for about 30 days and then stopped w/o any issue. Maybe I had a tiny tiny bit of lightheadedness, but I wouldn't call it dizziness and I am really sensitive to side effects.  But, the nice thing was when I told my shrink that didn't want to take it anymore, he said.. Okay, then don't.  No withdrawals, no having to taper, no after effects. || Buspar has been very helpful for me and my GAD.  I take a low dose, 5mg twice daily as an add-on to Prozac.  I am very sensitive to meds and have no issues with Buspar.   || Buspar is much milder than all the other antidepressants and doesn’t affect serotonin as much. I’m on a pretty high dose of it, and the worst I ever felt was some mild headaches, slight lightheadedness, and drowsiness, but those only lasted for an hour or two after taking a dose and stopped happening altogether after a couple weeks. I know it’s scary, but you have very little to lose by trying it and A LOT to lose by suffering from GAD. You’ve got this! || I used to snort it in prison || Wait a second…. Restless leg syndrome is a side effect of Buspar? I got restless leg syndrome after starting Buspar, aligned pretty close to the time I started it. I blamed Buspar because of the coincidence but my doctor assured me it’s not possible. 

My legs got so stiff that I was honestly struggling to function. I’ve been weaning off Buspar against my doctors will, because they don’t think it’s possibly correlated but I think it is. So far it’s been about 3 weeks and it’s probably 75% better. But now I just get what is mild restless leg syndrome but not so severe that I can’t walk (which is how it was before).

"Has Anyone Else Had AWFUL, Nightmarish Experiences On Remeron/Mirtazapine?","Around a month ago, I (27M) started taking 7.5mg nightly, upping to 15mg about two weeks ago. Since then, my anxiety has absolutely EXPLODED in a way so significant that it's almost hard to comprehend. I historically do not struggle with anxiety, and was prescribed Remeron exclusively to combat depression after previous medications had completely unacceptable sexual side effects. Even on Wellbutrin, which does nothing to treat anxiety, I did not struggle with anxiety. I've used cannabis for years without a single anxious or paranoid thought. That has all changed very suddenly. 

I was told that this medication is primarily known for sedation and increasing appetite, both of which are selling points to me. Instead, I'm now perpetually and severely anxious, agitated, and feel like I could die at any moment. I had my very first panic attack at work, something which has never happened before this medication, and now I'm suffering minor panic attacks on a daily basis. I can't think straight and I can't focus at all. Even my heart skipping a beat is enough to send me spiraling. I used to love driving, so much so that I've only ever owned fun-to-drive cars. Now with every commute, I'm afraid that I'll have a heart attack in traffic and help won't be able to get to me. Even sitting still for 2 minutes to brush my teeth has become a challenge. I feel like my heart is THUNKING with every beat as it tries to EXPLODE out of my chest. I scheduled an examination with a cardiologist because I'm constantly afraid that I'm about to have a heart attack.

But that's not all!

This medication has turned me into a screaming, raging lunatic to the extent that my family is now genuinely concerned. I've never felt such visceral, uncontrollable rage in my life. Minor inconveniences get me so worked up that I feel like I'm going to explode. And once I'm worked up, I feel completely out of control, like I need to scream at the top of my lungs. I've thrown my phone at the wall with full force. 

This started with mild side effects that have only continued getting worse the longer I've been on the medication. I'm honestly stunned and feel deceived. I was told that this is a medication known for relatively mild effects and relatively mild side effects. What I've instead experienced is the most powerful, profoundly negative side effects of my entire life. I know medications affect people differently, but in what universe is this medication anything other than a massive health risk? I cannot live like this and I've scheduled an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist to get off this medication as soon as humanly possible.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I've seen countless people say it made them fat or that it made them not want to get out of bed every day, and I've seen a few people mention being anxious on it, but I've not seen anything about this. I've called in sick to work today because I truly feel like I'm on the verge of a complete psychological breakdown. If you've experienced anything like this, how difficult was it for you to get off this awful drug? How long did it take for you to feel normal again? I feel like I can barely take another day of this.","Yeah, stop taking it.

Mirtazapine has been a life-saver for me, restoring much of the motivation and color in life that was taken away by the SSRI.

But if it's not working for you \*this\* badly, please stop. We find this pretty commonly, that meds can work wonderfully for some and be the worst nightmare for others.

Stop. || I had the worst experience with Mirtazapine, same as you described. Nightmares, personality change, even periods with serotonin syndrome. I've also tried Paroxetin before, similar issues. What finally worked for me was Escitalopram (Cipralex drops). The weight gain is a general side effect of serotonine inhibitors, but I never had nightmares with Escitalopram. Suffering severe side effects is not intended and you don't have to stick to a med which makes things worse. Speak to your doctor. I hope you'll find the medication which works for you. || I suffered extreme rage and incredibly distressing violent thoughts after I was started on Mirtazipine. I stopped taking them after a few weeks because the effects were so bad and I was terrified of what I might do. || Thanks. I'm seeing my psychiatrist first thing tomorrow to taper off this ASAP. I've unfortunately already tried Escitalopram and found the sexual side effects intolerable, but obviously that pales in comparison to what I'm going through currently. || mirtazapine was a miracle drug for me, with specifically insomnia and an existing anxiety disorder. Not only did it let me sleep again, but it also brought back a lot of the joy in life that I lost with taking SSRIs. More motivated, better with people, pretty much everything.

You can't make blanket statements, there's almost nothing that works the same for everyone. || The sexual side effects pass after few weeks.

Anxiety attacks without cause,"I've always felt slightly anxious in certain situations(mostly social)

5 months ago at work I felt my heart racing randomly. And it seemed like it just triggered into an anxiety attack

Shortness of breath/shallow breathing
No 160/110
HR around 140+
Sense of impending doom

A follow up at my Dr and after our discussion got put on metroprolol tartrate 25mg 2x daily to manage my anxiousness and BP

Quit smoking, better choices in diet, moderate cardio 3-5x week and have felt a lot better

Bp and pulse have been great, 110-130/80-85 and a resting pulse around 60-80

But last night, same thing. I didn't feel well and felt anxious so I laid down for a nap to see if that helped

Woke up and HR was elevated, probobly around 110 but began to ""feel"" my heart pounding which I'm guessing induced some panic. BP was 170/110, HR was 150, shallow breathing, impending doom feeling, not able to sit still and going back and forth( almost same symptoms as 5 months ago) I was 2 hours away from my 2nd dose of beta blocker, so I took it immediately and got someone to take my to the FD, BP 140-160/100-105 HR 130-145 with normal rhythm (  personal BP cuff scared me as it was detecting irregular rhythm).


After sitting in ER for around a couple hours I'm guessing the beta blocker started taking the edge off, BP stay around 130-140/ 90-95 while in ER, pulse hovered between 80-105 because I kept having burst of anxiousness.

While the beta blocker did take the edge off and lower me enough to not panic as bad, I was still disappointed as I didn't expect to be able to have almost the same attack on metroprolol


All my blood work/EKG/x-ray was normal(same as last time) but even tho the beta blocker mostly corrected my attack symptoms I still had burst of anxiousness feeling that made me feel uneasy (and caused those spikes to 105 HR)....which im sure if it wasn't for the beta blocker the attack would have been much longer. 

I told them I was still feeling anxious and they gave me a Xanax and a prescription for Hydroxyzine 25 mg 3x daily as needed. The xanxex took the rest of my anxiousness away so I was discharged and immediately felt calmer. 

Last night my vital got much closer to baseline 130/88, HR in the low 80s.

This morning I feel drained, slight anxiousness that comes and goes, some fatigue and just lack of will to do much, but my vitals are back to 115/75 ish and HR in the 70s


I have a Dr appt tommorow and I wanted to know if there was any benefit to doing extended release metroprolol rather than immediate, my reasoning being I think as my first daily dose wears off I am susceptible to these anxiety issues (I was on hour 10-12 of my first dose when this happened) 

And secondly I don't think I need Xanax regularly, but do they give you a small amount for an ""as needed"" solution for if I feel an attack coming on

Or if I possibly need a daily prescription for something else

"TW: Health anxiety, c word"," I'm getting a lump in my inguinal area checked out tomorrow. It's only really visible when I clench my muscles.

 I've had it for about a year without change, but I started worrying about it a month ago.
I was out of the country so I couldn't get it checked out immediately, and in the span of this one month I've developed random symptoms, pains everywhere, dizziness...

 I showered at night and forgot to blow dry my hair, which caused me to wake up with neck pain. I've also burnt my tongue and now I have swollen, painful lymph nodes under my chin. I'm panicking and convinced the docs will tell me I'm going to die.
 I'm only 17 and I'm supposed to go to Japan in less than two weeks. I'm terrified :(. Any support would be appreciated.",,1753729873.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbpcqt/tw_health_anxiety_c_word/,Anxiety
I am scared of my... shower door,"This month is the first time I'm living far from home in a new house, and almost everything is working perfectly fine.

I work in a hospital and I've heard about these shattering, and my old bathroom didn't even had a shower door... I'm kinda paranoid now about it. I know the odds of it shattering are very low, but still, I've seen it happen to a friend and more than once in the hospital where I work for the last few years. it's the first time I had this kinda of fear for something that trivial, I always had anxiety connected to bigger things, but never was I so nervous for something like this.

Heat Intolerance Worse as you Get Older?,"I've had Heat intolerance my whole life, now 32, guy.
I've noticed ever since I turned 30 it's been steadily getting worse, especially this year. Anyone else relate and have Heat Intolerance?
Has it gotten worse for you over the years & as you get older?
I can't stay out if its past 80 or humid and 80. I just overheat, I Don't sweat, feel gross, & like not well-hard to explain. Takes a bit to cool down :(","Hard yes. Im 42. Last few years have had quite an impact on my anxiety. Hydration and good sleep make it better, but on hot days my anxiety ratchets up in a big way. Feel like this is why people head south for a mild winter and head north for a mild summer. But im not at the age or financial well being to have that option. || This is me but with the cold. I used to LOVE the freezing cold, and I could wear a tshirt in 10 degree weather and feel so good, but now I can barely go out in 18 degree weather without some kind of thick jumper on. || Some meds like Zoloft can also increase temperature sensitivity. || Yes, late 30s and I can’t tolerate heat and sunburns. I used to just feel prickly and stinging when sunburnt. Not I get the chills, racing heart. Basically sun poisoning for burns of a similar degree in the past that didn’t feel so harsh. 

Very hot and humid weather gives me anxiety because it feels harder to breathe and I need to stay very hydrated. Never felt like that in my younger years. Tho I still much more prefer summer over winter. || I'm 50 and starting to go through menopause and this hot weather is killing me! I have this little fan that I wear around my neck all day or I'll fry to death! It's a bummer because I used to really love being outside in the summer, now I hide in the house with my air conditioner. || I can’t stand heat || Yep, I do not like the heat. Especially when it’s humid it just feels so oppressive and anxiety triggering. 

Tho I also feel more anxious when I’m shivering because it’s cold || At least one of these statements is true, if not all of them:

1. My heat intolerance is getting worse as I age
2. It's getting hotter every year
3. As I get older I don't care to spend as much energy ignoring minor annoyances, like overheating.

Probably all three. It sucks that I live in Phoenix to boot. || I have noticed this, I used to love the heat and heatwaves but the last 3 years I've found it a sensory nightmare and just as unbearable as extreme cold. No idea what changed other than I am now in my 40s. || For sure!! I went to an event yesterday. It was in the full sun, 85-90 degrees. Luckily, it was only a half hour. I brought a wet sweat towel, a neck fan, and a very small cooler for ice. By the end, I was putting an ice cube over my arms, legs and neck. It’s not pretty. It’s not cute. But I made it through. My world was getting smaller because I was avoiding any events with a risk of overheating. I’ve found some ways to help. 
I am hypothyroid and being treated. I also have vestibular migraine, and have a history of heat exhaustion. Add a dash of perimenopause and my body just can’t wait to overheat🤣 || I'm 34 and the heat cooks me like an oven. I get dizzy and scared. It's soo bright ... I'm trying so hard to overcome it. Definitely understand .

The sun isnt the same anymore. . It's not just you .. the sun is white and scorching Like a led light.. no more warm yellow orange glow of 1999 🌞 || Yes! I have noticed this as I've gotten older too. I'm 34 but the last few years I have noticed the same. I feel like I get hot faster and even if I'm not full on sweating I'll feel awful! My husband too. He used to be able to go outside and do whatever, hardly sweat.. Now he goes out and he will be DRENCHED in sweat. I think it's just one of those things that some of us have to deal with as we get older. || Yes!  Hormones definitely play a role. Unclear how much though. I suspect perimenopause as its symptoms might begin a decade before actually going into menopause.

I’m almost 40 and I have never been a summer person but the last few years have been hell. I live in a humid climate, I don’t have a/c and can’t get enough sleep because of the heat which only makes things worse. Just this morning I had a horrible panic attack.

Climate change is definitely making things worse too. || Yes but check for perimenopause symptoms too. || I struggle with the heat myself. It makes me feel unwell and unpleasant. Can I ask, what do you experience exactly with heat intolerance? || Yes, and unfortunately global warming also gets worse as we get older. 😭 A/C save me || Since I had a heat stroke overseas it’s been worse worse part is I’m having difficulty getting the VA to approve it as a service connected disability || Yes I’m 42 in Northern California we regularly are over 100 degrees and it never rains I’m looking to move to Oregon or Washington coast mostly just for the weather.the heat is worse every year older I am || It fucking feels like it. (31 for reference) || Ohhh yes, 🙃 It’s like, you hit a certain age and suddenly summer feels like it’s out to get you. I swear, I used to be fine in the heat, like, bring on the sun, right? But now?

Scared to start my medication,"I’ve been struggling with my OCD, GAD, and panic disorder for a while now. One of my biggest fears is medication. I know exactly how many pills I’ve taken since this year began, and (with the exception of 2) they were only antibiotics for a tooth infection. 

I was prescribed Zoloft for my anxiety disorders 3 months ago. They’ve just been sitting on my end table because I’m too scared to take the plunge. I’m scared of side effects, how i’ll immediately start over analyzing my mind/body, and how i’ll feel completely out of control or have that “oh god, what have I done” thought right after I start the dose. 

Logically I know the medication has a huge potential to help me, but emotionally it feels like such a big risk. I want to get better and I know my ERP/CBT therapy hasn’t been super beneficial because of how extreme my anxiety is, but it’s so hard. 

Any words of encouragement, advice, or positive experiences with Zoloft would be appreciated. Thank you!","Hey! I take Zoloft with Propranol as well. The first couple weeks suck I wont lie, but the weight lifted off my shoulders is immense. I got hot sweats, worse anxiety for a bit, diarrhea and I would do it all again if its what it takes. I take 75 mg so not a lot to be fair. It does smother some of my more positive emotions but id rather my colors be a little less bright then to only see grey. If you force yourself to take them for the month (barring any real side effects that hamper your day to day) I think you'll find they help more than hurt. || Hi, it's a balancing act, I guess. How bad are your symptoms, do the benefits outstrip the side affects. I used zoloft for 4 years, here's my experience on them. i to was hesitant, eventually I caved and took them,  they took about 5 weeks to start working properly and I got side affects first few weeks, nothing crazy. They worked great for me, however when I come off them it was hard and experienced side affects, again nothing crazy but I did struggle at first but after a month or so they settled down. || Hello. 
I think it's a pretty normal feeling most of us experience when first starting out on medication. 
I can recall these exact thoughts and feelings when I finally reached out for help and was given medication. 
I let it sit there and just suffer with my anxiety and depression. 

I'm not sure why I was so scared to take a pill. 
I was given one to take at the ER, just like the one I was afraid to continue to take. I couldn't wrap my head around it, but I seriously just sat and stayed there suffering. My symptoms started to get worse, and that is when I got brave enough to say to myself, take the pill! From that day on, it's been my saving grace. 

I first started on Zoloft but I felt it wasn't helping me as it should. So, I was then prescribed Fluoxetine 20 mg and Clonazepan 1 mg, which is my current dose, and it's like my lifeguard through these times.

I highly suggest you take your pill. Trust me, medication helps. If you happen to get any side effects, quickly contact your prescribing doctor or head to the ER if it's a serious side effect. 

I have tried several different medications for my condition, and I have never experienced any real concerning effects, to be honest. 

I say, give it a try. Try not to dwell on the thought too much like I did before finally taking my medication.
Once you find the right dose the works for you, you will start to live again, and I really can't stress that enough. 

I am rooting for you and want you to know that you are not alone. If you need anyone to talk to, please feel free to send me a chat. 

You got this! Please keep me updated. 
I wish you all the best. || I also am scared of medication, except Xanax. I love that because it makes me feel so good. I have been on Zoloft 3 times. It is the only SSRI that has worked somewhat for me. No major side effects. My complaints and why I always stop taking it is I get too flat, feel nothing and can’t orgasm. I am never good about tapering off, I just stop and had brain zaps for a bit, but nothing major. I would take it, Zoloft has been good for me. || I can vouch for what you stated as well.

4 year old with anxiety,"Hi all,

I'm making this post because I'm feeling lost, defeated, and just sad. I'm a married dad to 2 amazing girls, four and two. 

My four year old has pretty bad anxiety, extreme shyness, and an overall lack of confidence in public settings. This flares up especially if she happens to be the center of attention which she tries to avoid. She also seems to show signs of what would probably be ADHD.

I'm reaching a point where I feel like a total failure as a parent because of not being able to get her anxiety under control. When something triggers her anxiety, she loses it, tries to hide, screams, throws herself on the floor and it just breaks my heart to watch. At that point, she's just inconsolable. An example is getting up in front of her class to accept an end of year award for finishing preschool. It absolutely spiraled out of control. 

We've tried occupational therapy for roughly 4 months and we weren't seeing an ounce of progress. We're now looking for other options and that's why I'm here. I'm feeling like I'm letting her down and am so worried about her future. Part of me is hoping she'll grow out of it.  

Has anyone gone through something similar and if so, do you have any specific recommendations? Sorry for the long post, I'm just all over the place with how I'm feeling. ",,1753714025.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbi605/4_year_old_with_anxiety/,Anxiety
Throwing a bday party,"Hi, my birthday is coming up and I would like to have a party.

I really like theme parties and since I don't have friends who do them, I thought “screw it,I'll have one, if no one will celebrate me, I'll celebrate myself, life is only one”.

The problem is that I'm getting anxious thinking that no one will come. In total I could invite about 10 people, and I have friends in another city and they told me they could come, but what if they cancel? What if only 2 people come? What if they think everything is too weird and embarrassing? Will they think I'm boring?

For people who have already done parties, how do you do it? How do you keep the party going for several hours?

Extreme Fatigue,"Ok, I'm sick of this extreme fatigue that seems to be happening randomly for the past year! 

So here is the update:

I struggle with anxiety, depression, and OCD. It's pretty manageable up until I realized my SSRI was not working anymore and went down a path for over a year figuring out what medication works best for me. The past 6 months I have tried different dosages and different medications until I was told by my new psychiatrists to take a genetics test that tells you what medications work with your genetics.

Now, even after feeling better on this new medication, I somehow still got extreme fatigue this weekend! I slept from 11pm to 4:30pm on Friday night to Saturday evening!! and was still tired Sunday.

I mainly get anxiety about driving,"I was wondering if anyone has some general advice with anxiety about driving.


I have more anxiety about the anticipation of having to drive more than actual driving itself. It gets bad if I haven't drove in a while because I'm scared that I forgot how to drive. I also get nervous in big cities especially downtown areas. I do it though. I've traveled several hours places before on my own even with a child. I just get really stressed out before it even happens for some reason.

It used to be worse and learning to drive was a nightmare, but I was forced to get my license at 18. My family had to get an actual driving instructor because of my anxiety back then. There has been improvement. I'll still freak out though if I had to drive a manual car. Driving bigger vehicles like trucks give me anxiety too.","i have such bad anxiety behind the wheel of a car that i never got my license. ive been made fun of for it, so i dont ever tell anyone anymore. pretty sure they assume driving is easy and\or that the anxiety goes away over time, but in my experience it never did. i hated it so much.

i just wish driving anxiety was more understood bc its soo real. || I'm not really sure how to help, but here's my experience. I was so nervous and anxious about driving that I didn't get my license until age 20, and refused to drive without my dad in the car until just about a month ago. I think the anxiety was worse than the actual thing, because once I started driving on my own, I was totally fine and I feel like I could drive anywhere now. I sincerely hope it gets better for you! || I was forced to get my license because I lost my parents young. I did grew out of most anxieties, but driving has stuck around. It's improved, but it's still there. It does help doing it more. If I don't drive for a bit, it comes back so I have to restart. Definitely never completely goes away for some reason. I feel like I'm annoying when I get other people to drive when I'm with them though because I'm scared of it especially with other people. Also, I've been DD several times and it's stressful because driving stresses me out so much and the people just drink expecting me to drive a lot. It's okay I guess for the exposure. 😭 || Thanks! I do notice I do get more anxiety if I don't drive often. I had to drive for the first time in a few weeks today. I more anxious about it than actually doing it.

Unending Season,"
( this is a kinda poem/creative writing thing I did, it’s a little pessimistic so use your own discretion <3 just wanted to see if anybody else can relate, this has been the only way I’ve been able to really explain my anxiety in a way that I feel like it might make sense to other people )

Is it worse to be too hot or too cold? Everybody has an answer, one extreme is too unbearable. You wonder how your ancestors withstood it, if their lives consisted of constant suffering. They didn’t have wool coats or air conditioning, they were exposed. Completely raw. There was nothing between them and the elements. Somehow they persevered, at least until reproductive age but often times well past that.

Did their lives consist nearly solely of suffering? What did they see in the spaces between that pushed them to keep going? 

For you, there are buffers and luxuries that the modern world affords. You should be grateful that you are not left completely unequipped to deal with nature’s harshest punishments, but it doesn’t feel bearable. It doesn’t feel manageable. 

It’s that kind of extreme temperature that occupies your entire body and mind. It’s all you can think about, it’s all you can sense.
The kind that you might forget about for a moment, only until you notice you’ve forgotten. Then it somehow seems worse than you remembered. 
The kind that makes you grit your teeth in anticipation for its end, and forces you to consider how you are not enjoying life as much as you could be if it weren’t for this overwhelming sensation.

You can wrap yourself in a blanket, or take a cold shower, and it helps a for a time. Even if just a little bit. You feel like there must be some ending to this insufferable cold or heat, that if you can stop it for a small moment then maybe those moments will eventually add up into something worth while. 
But it isn’t enough. Inevitably the wind eats you through to the bone or you squirm with the itching boil beneath the surface of your skin. 
It’s inside you now. Even if this unending season finally passes, you know you will never be able to forget the feelings. How it ate you up inside. How it consumed your thoughts and your personhood. And how terrified you will be to face that unending season if it returns. 

It comes with symptoms too. You shiver, you sweat. You feel stiff, dizzy, nauseous, lethargic, shake-y. You don’t want to eat, or maybe you eat too much, and you can’t sleep anymore. Physical activity repulses you, being close to others is even worse. Life inside of your own skin is not the same as it once was. You doubt whether it ever will be again, yearning to feel at home here instead of wishing to crawl out of yourself. 

You feel like you’ll lose your mind entirely or completely break down, and sometimes you do. But you always come back, and the temperature is just as unbearable as before.

You can’t bear to peel yourself from your blankets, or off the hardwood floor, but you do anyway. Life has stopped for you, but the world continues to flow around you unhindered. 
That’s the worst part: no one else feels this heatwave or sees the blizzard. You wonder if they even believe you at all. 

It’s a new day. You wake up, your chest screams for that fresh, clean, clear air. You open your front door and take a breath, but nothing has changed. It’s still slick and muggy, or frigid and dry.

I don’t live in an amazing area but it’s also not terrible. i’m a teen and i live with my parents so im not alone but im still scared to go to sleep tonight because murderers clearly don’t care how many people are in the house. i don’t know if this is irational or not because it very well could happen to me. my moms car was broken into a few months ago so what is stopping someone from breaking into the house.","you’re not overreacting that case really shook people up but your brain’s just stuck in fight mode from all that true crime stuff. it’s rare stuff not everyday life. maybe talk to your parents and take a break from the heavy content. you’re safe. your brain just needs help remembering that. || You'll be fine ... It's just your anxiety talking. 

And if it were to happen, send them to me, I'm ready. || I remember this case really shaking me up, too. But after avoiding reading ur for a while, eventually, I just came back into a state of not remembering it at all. 
Just refrain from reading about the idaho 4 or any similar cases for a while, distract yourself with things that make you smile or laugh! 
Remember to be safe, make sure all doors are locked before you sleep, and if it makes you feel better, put a chair up against your bedroom door handle. 

I can promise you that soon enough (if you protect your peace like the other comment says) that you'll be in a state of ease

I know it's not easy atm with your anxiety being so high, but this will be the worst of it and I promise you'll feel better soon. Don't fixate on it || this fear’s real but also a little overpowered right now. you’re not alone in the house. your doors are locked. stuff like the idaho case messes with your head because it’s rare and brutal. but that’s the point. it made the news because it’s not normal. don’t let your brain make it feel close to home. if true crime is messing with your sleep take a break from it. your safety isn’t perfect but it’s way better than your brain’s making it seem at 2am || That's why you have the right to bear arms. I also got Perimeter Alarms loaded with non lethal for anyone that shouldn't be that close. || That fear is natural and has helped our species survive thousands of years. So be glad you feel it!

What you should not allow is that fear stop you. You must use it to improve!  Think of ways you can take care of yourself and your family (not necessarily a gun). Think about what you would do in those situations if they occur. Talk to your family about safety in your home. Reflect on what you can control and what you can't. 

And I recommend doing therapy, because it is always very useful. || I would stop consuming true crime or horror content, because if you’re like me, it will make you super paranoid no matter what || I really relate to this. I moved to Boise Idaho last year and the sentencing just took place in Boise and the proximity of it all is really freaking me out tbh || Ughhhh I feel the same! This is why I want a gun || I am on the same boat. I am absolutely terrified. When I was about 8, a burglar broke into our house through the kitchen window. Everyone was in their rooms with their doors closed- but me. I decided to be a ""big girl"" and asked my mom if I could sleep on the couch. This was a huge step for me because I was terrified of the dark, and the living room wasn't my favorite place to be. Anyway, the next morning I woke up and everything around me was stolen. Now I am even more than terrified of what would've happened to me if I woke up during the burglary. My best friend and I used to always joke about it but I am sure we did so out of nervousness than anything.",1753664519.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb2syc/im_scared_of_someone_breaking_into_my_house_and/,Anxiety

Buspirone (Buspar) struggles.,"About two months ago I was put on buspar (10mg 2x daily) to manage anxiety (more importantly the rage that is symptomatic of anxiety). I took it as prescribed for the first two weeks. 10mg in the morning. 10mg before bed. And over all with mood I felt great by the end of the two weeks. But that morning dose made me feel TERRIBLE, even after a few weeks. My body feels heavy and I get brain and body zaps and incredibly fatigued. If I stayed up and fairly active it wasn’t as bad, but if it was sitting when it started (usually about 30 min after taking it) I was useless. So I dropped to 5mg in the AM and 10mg before bed. 

The problem is the combined 20mg a day seems way more affective than the combined 15mg a day. It’s honestly frustrating that I finally started to feel better just to slip back because I can’t tolerate the more affective dosage. ","Buspar kicked my ass with the dizzy side effects. I feel you, it was so nice that it seemed to be helping the first couple weeks. Then for me, it kinda just stopped working entirely and I went back to panicking daily, and also suddenly got very depressed. Going off Buspar has been a relief just to not experience a full hour of the spins after I take it. I’m trying Zoloft now || I’ve tried Zoloft before (a few times actually). It’s not super effective for me personally. It also makes everything dull for me. It was nice when “sad” didnt feel like the world was crumbling around me. But “happy” also stopped feeling actually happy. It was always in this very narrow neutral zone. || I understand that, that’s how Prozac made me feel as a teenager. It’s pretty rough. Personally where I am right now, i describe it as feeling like my good emotions are very quiet whispers and my bad emotions are incredibly loud. I’ve been feeling like that since before the medications, so I’m willing to take the risk of numbness for now since I’m not feeling very happy anyway lol || Oh are you eating with your buspar btw? What I was told, though of course follow your own doctors directions, is that you don’t *have* to eat with buspar but you can either pick an empty stomach or food and you’ve got to take it the same way each time. 

I decided to start taking mine with food every time since I usually took the second dose a bit after dinner, and I noticed that my dizziness in the morning improved when taking the buspar with food versus empty stomach.",1753721820.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mblod1/buspirone_buspar_struggles/,Anxiety
Nodes,"Good morning,
I'm very anxious at the moment. For several months, I have had a hard lymph node under my chin, which swells then deflates at times. I had an ultrasound, and the doctor told me it could be related to tooth decay I had at the time.

For a month, I have felt another lymph node on the right side, which reacts in the same way: it swells then deflates. Last week, I was on vacation, and neither lymph node was swollen – it even reassured me. But since I returned to work (where things are going very badly and where I have anxiety attacks), the right lymph node has reappeared, accompanied by pain.

I made an appointment for another ultrasound. Has anyone ever experienced this? Can stress cause this kind of reaction?",,1753721724.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mblmqy/nodes/,Anxiety

It wouldn’t happen while I was awake, but the moment I fell asleep, I just started profusely sweating. I’m NOT one to sweat in my sleep. Does anyone get night sweats from anxiety?

I feel weirdly guilty about this,"
Me(22F) and my brother(19M) have our rooms in the same upper floor and they’re like right next to each other. We still live with our parents and our rooms have been like this since our parents gave their room to my brother while I kept mine because of the space of our house and we can’t really build other rooms.

So, since our rooms are very close I have always had been extra careful when masturbating due to the fear of being walked in or something. I don’t have a key to my room, but me and my brother have always discussed how the moment we see each other’s doors closed we knock or we don’t enter due to privacy. I still feel horrendously guilty everytime I masturbate though because in my mind the door has to be locked with a key and everyone in the house SHOULD be asleep before I masturbate otherwise it counts as me harrasing my sibling/parents. There’s been many times where I was done doing it in my room and then heard voices talking and I immediately would feel disgusting because in my mind masturbating shouldn’t be done when other people around the house are awake since it’s weird? Just my thought process. Also I can’t really do anything because most of people my age where I live still live with their parents/siblings and so do I, so getting some privacy after work or on the weekends is pretty hard because I can never get the house to myself.

I masturbated this morning, closed my door and my window, was obviously quiet and quick and didn’t make any unnecessary disruptive noise. But when I woke up later, to go downstairs and I pass his room, I see that my brother’s door of his room was open and while yes he was sleeping and obviously I was masturbating in MY OWN ROOM with my door closed and no one came in or no one saw me, now I feel guilty that his door was open and I keep thinking maybe I should have closed it before I went back to my room and closed mine too. For some reason I feel dirty and I’m having this weird fear of: what if I was a creep? what if i touched him in some way inappropriate? what if i was being weird? I’m just really struggling with this so I’d appreciate advice. Like I just need to get over this anxiety or whatever obsession it is with me worrying about it constantly.

I keep thinking that I should have gone and shut his door and then came back to mine and shut mine or something and it makes me feel disgusting. Like I know I obviously masturbated with my bedroom door closed and I knew nobody would come in for sure but I just feel like I have assaulted my sibling and I feel disgusting either way.

Oh and please to weird ass people don’t be weird about this, it’s genuinely a fear and a problem I have and deal with. ","You did nothing wrong. These are just intrusive thoughts, let them pass. || i completely understand what you're going through. please know that you haven't done anything wrong and that you may be suffering from intrusive thoughts (see also: pur o, I'm not sure what the exact term is, but being obsessed with the idea of hurting someone unintentionally or fearing that you secretly want to abuse someone seems to fit the definition).

i struggled with this a lot during my teenage years, with an absolute fear of being sexually inappropriate, predatory, or dangerous. i ended up severely depressed, hating myself, and unaware that I was suffering from a form of ocd.

the thoughts you experience have nothing to do with your worth as a person, your moral compass, or your deepest desires. obsessions and compulsions harm us by creating doubt and suspicion about the subjects or people we care deeply about, and are often very taboo.

don’t let shame silence you. i encourage you to seek help if you continue to struggle with these thoughts and guilt. therapy is very effective for these types of problems!

take care xx || You’re just overthinking a very simple problem you have. Your room is private for a reason; nothing you do while the door is closed should be anyone else’s business. Masturbating isn’t wrong and it’s definitely not assaulting your brother in any capacity (even if he did know you were doing it Becuase I’m sure he does it too, as does everyone else). None of what you described makes you come off as a creep, you just probably feel a little embarrassed and that’s completely understandable. Maybe you could ask your parents if you could change the doorknob into one with a lock just so you feel more secure in your private space. If they’re not okay with it, maybe just jerk off in the shower or while you have music playing so there isn’t a chance of someone overhearing you. || Thank you so much!

It’s just really hard because our rooms are close to each other and my brain latches on that fact or the fact my door wasn’t locked, just closed and how that contributed to me just spiraling. It just caught on these details and I felt very disgusting. I know it’s normal to masturbate, I just have that fear of harming someone. || Thank you so much! Yes, I know that. Just my brain latched on the fact his door was open(it’s very hot during summer so he left his door open i assume from the heat) so I immediately thought it was weird of me to do that in my room since our rooms are very close together and I just weirdly felt…just not good lol I don’t know how to rationally explain this without sounding irrational!! || I obviously checked to see if everyone was sleeping and wouldn’t bother me or knock on my door so my brother was sleeping and my parents downstairs and I thought it was a good moment to unwind before starting the day. || I completely understand what you’re trying to say, you just want to be respectful to your family and avoid making anyone uncomfortable. That’s not irrational. I do think the way you view masturbating behind closed doors as potentially “assaulting” your brother is a bit irrational, but that’s probably just a byproduct of your overthinking. At the end of the day, you’re doing everything in your power to be as discreet and respectful as possible and that’s all that matters. Your brain is probably just trying to protect you from an embarrassing encounter with your family, so just try not to think too much about it.

Panic State/ Afraid of psychosis,"I’m making this post because i truly don’t know what else to do anymore. Following a pretty traumatic event earlier this year (finding out my bf of 5 years was cheating) I decided to take action against my anxiety by taking lexapro 5mg. It was my first time taking anything for mental health and i absolutely hated the side effects, brain fog, nausea and just did not feel like myself. I only lasted 3 days on it because of this and right after this i went into a panic state that lasted 2 months. I was waking up with anxiety every single day, my thoughts felt like they were going 100mph, i couldn’t think straight and couldn’t even really listen to people fully when they would speak to me because i was so in my head, i also had a very hard time concentrating and kept forgetting everything because i was constantly thinking. My thoughts would be mostly about me questioning if i have a mental health condition , any thought that came into my head i would question it thinking is that a normal thought do i have adhd ocd am i depressed or if i had psychosis (this fear comes from me dealing with DPDR after smoking weed). I even took myself to the hospital hoping to go into the psych unit because i was so afraid. After this awful episode i finally felt normal again about 3 weeks ago.. it felt like i snapped out of it , i truly felt like myself again i wasnt questioning every thought that came into my head i wasnt overthinking about anything. But now it’s back, and i truly feel hopeless. I’m at a point where i think im giving myself a mental illness, my biggest fear right now is psychosis. This got triggered because the one symptom i have that does remain no matter what is that i always have music playing in my head, like i even wake up like this, and that makes me afraid to have adhd. Now my brain feels very confused and hectic again i have thoughts about what if i gave myself psychosis because i keep getting random thoughts and flashbacks of the past or when i think of anything that correlates with a song my head starts singing it or sometimes i feel like my head isn’t thinking how it should and im afraid to believe things that aren’t true. I guess im on here to see if anyone else is going through an episode like this or if anyone has any advice, i know this is all over the place because i feel all over the place so i do apologize ",,1753720478.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbl24h/panic_state_afraid_of_psychosis/,Anxiety
"When you wake up manic, ride the wave…","I’ve learned over the course of my 35 year struggle with anxiety, depression, and ADHD that sometimes I have to just use what I have. I woke up manic this morning. I generally hate mania, but this morning, I’ll do my best to ride the wave and be as productive as possible.

To help ensure that doesn’t happen, I know that today, I’ll have to take breaks, practice my breathing exercises and nourish my body with good things - avoid sugar and drink lots of water.

Pregnant and anxious and crazy,"I have always had anxiety issues. Since I was a little kid. I’m now 28. 23 weeks pregnant and it is getting worse. 

Love my husband but the man is NOT helpful. He doesn’t experience anxiety and doesn’t get it all. He doesn’t understand why I’m worried about something that hasn’t even happened yet and might not even ever actually happen. 

But I know I’m not easy on him. When I get anxious I can get MEAN. I know I shouldn’t say certain things but it’s like I can’t stop myself and say it so quick before I can stop myself. It can’t be easy to be around. 

I have been a hot mess the past few weeks. I’ve cried a few times this week and lashed out at my husband. He’s not very comforting and doesn’t want to comfort me after I’ve been mean to him - which I get. But that makes me spiral even more. 

He’s never seen me like this before and I think he’s freaked out. 

I’m a teacher and on summer break which I think is making everything worse. I have nothing to do but sit at home and find stuff to worry about. I have deleted all social media apps but I can’t stop googling. 

I used to take Lexapro but I stopped taking it maybe 9 months ago. Mostly because I didn’t want to go to the doctor to renew prescription. I’ve never really wanted to do therapy. 

Well now that I’m about to be a mom - I can’t keep acting like this. I need therapy and medicine. I don’t have a regular doctor besides OB/GYN. I tried getting in with a psychologist but I need a referral from a doctor apparently. 

Can I just make an appointment with a regular doctor and tell them over the phone it’s because I have anxiety? Will this get me in quicker? I don’t want to keep waiting.

"I want to live life, I want my life back","ever since my panic attacks took over my life things just haven’t been the same. I just wanted to vent and talk about it here cause I don’t have anybody close to me that goes through this. I’m someone who enjoys doing things but my anxiety has made it really hard for me to just do anything especially alone. Whenever I try to run errands, try to socialize, drive.. etc I start to feel panicky and think I’m going to die like omg this can’t be life 🥲

I live in fear which I’m now learning for the longest I’ve been ignoring the fact that I’m scared of alot of stuff because the thought of knowing I’m scared seems stupid to me and I get annoyed with myself about it … 🥲","Ugh it’s so hard when it feels like anxiety is keeping you from doing the things you enjoy. Are you familiar with the window of tolerance theory? Every time you avoid something because of fear, anxiety or depression, it makes you feel safe in the short term but in the long term, your window for what you can handle shrinks. If you go out and do it anyways, it might be uncomfortable, it might not feel as fun as it used to, but eventually your window will grow and grow. One day you can go to the grocery store for three minutes without panicking, the next day maybe it’s five. It doesn’t feel good to do at first but it helps and gradually you might start feeling like you’re able to start venturing out and reclaiming those things that make you happy. It’s like eating spicy food every day until you get used to it and can enjoy it.

 How have I let it run my life like this?! Why?!

You're truly not alone. Its literally like your own personal hell. I get it.  

As someone whos afraid of everything and let anxiety take away everything, i say baby steps!! Make a goal for each day. 

Today ill drive around the block twice alone
Today I'll do something that i feel uncomfortable doing etc. || Very relatable! I think our own stigma about the anxiety we have is only going to stifle us more. You know that quote “unexpressed emotions will come forth in uglier ways” anything we reject and think is flawed and socially unacceptable or weak will not go away, it’ll just be there and one day it’ll start to manifest and hit us like a truck and then we literally won’t be able to ignore it anymore. It really doesn’t serve us to judge our anxiety. We’re human! It’s okay to have emotions even if only a smaller percentage of people would understand what we’re going through. We can’t keep putting expectations onto ourselves that are realistic only for people that don’t experience anxiety frequently. This kinda stuff, this is normal for us! No it’s not ideal and no it’s not easy to live with these issues, but everyone struggles with something even if not anxiety. Half of the battle of anxiety is realizing you perceive life differently and you have to make accommodations for yourself when you struggle and move on with your life, just like people with wheelchairs can’t take the stairs, there are things we can’t do, it just isn’t so clear to everyone on the outside because mental disorders are the physical disabilities that the eyes can’t see. And screw anybody that doesn’t understand this. You have to be kind to yourself because sometimes it may feel like you’re the only one that understands or will be there for you in your times of suffering. Just start recognizing ok, I need a ramp here, or today and I might not need it tomorrow. I need to cancel plans today but I’ll try to hang out with a friend for a shorter amount of time next week. Baby steps always. No pressure. None of this “I should be able to handle this no problem, I’m such a useless individual that can’t manage things everyone else can do without a problem, I’m falling apart”. It’s not helpful at all. It’s not true. It’s just a rough time that doesn’t define our entire life or our worth. || Your are not alone dear. I have been struggling with anxiety as well. Especially, the idea of going out scares me. But listen to me you will not die from anxiety. I know it feels really bad. Just try not to give up and one day you wont feel anything bad. Thoughts will disappear without any signs. You wont be aware of it and you wont remember all those bad memories. This is how it works. Plus, i would recommend you a book which helped me in a good way. It didn’t solve my entire problem but while i was having severe attacks it really helped me to understand what is going on my body.

I last flew about two years ago. It was a three-hour flight, and everything went fine. After that flight, I actually felt like I had overcome my fear of flying. But now, two years later, the fear is suddenly back and worse than before. Not just a bit of nervousness, but full-on physical symptoms: tight chest, shortness of breath, racing heart. Just thinking about flying makes me feel sick. I've tried booking flights a few times, but every time I get halfway through the booking process and can't finish it.

What’s really frustrating is that the fear has started to spread. It’s not just about flying anymore: I now feel uneasy even thinking about travelling in general. Even long car rides make me nervous. It’s like my original fear of flying has slowly grown into a broader anxiety around leaving home or going away for more than a few days. And I really don’t want that. I want to fight this and be able to travel freely again. Flying used to feel like freedom to me, and I really miss that.

One thing that makes it even harder is that I’d actually love to fly somewhere warm with my girlfriend. She doesn’t have any fear of flying and really enjoys the sea. She’s super understanding and never pressures me, but I still feel guilty. I want to give her those experiences too: beach holidays, sunshine, just relaxing somewhere beautiful. And when I realize I might be the one holding us back, it feels like a vicious cycle I can’t get out of. That just adds to the anxiety and makes it even harder to take the first step.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? A specific fear growing into something more general? How did you deal with it?
I'm considering just doing it anyway, facing the fear head-on and flying again, but honestly, that first step feels so hard right now.

I’d really appreciate hearing about your experiences, advice, or just some honest thoughts from people who get what this feels like.

Thanks so much","This is how agoraphobia starts. It's a slippery slope. Do not stop traveling. Do not stop getting in the car. Mine got to the point where I couldn't leave my bedroom. I'm slowly making my way into longer trips but I had to travel an hour and a half away this weekend and even that kind of wrecked me. 

The only way out is through, it's doing it. || Thanks very much for your answer! That's sad to hear that you've got agoraphobia. But you're doing great and you can achieve everything if you've survived this trip even if it wrecked you! I don't know you, but I'm proud of you anyway. I know how difficult this is and how big of an achievement it is that you did it!

Have you any tips about how you did it? How you did ""train"" yourself? Did you take any medication? || I haven't taken medication only because I have tried 10+ with no luck so I just raw dog exposure therapy 🙃.

I’d rather be ugly without anxiety than attractive with it.,"25m. I feel so stupid when it comes to getting girls. All the friends I still have are in relationships and it really bothers me how easy it is for them to just start talking to some chick then start hooking up then dating. 

I feel every stupider because I guess I am attractive, I’ve been with some gorgeous women in the past and I’ve heard from numerous girls that I’m cute but that doesn’t matter when I fumble the bag before I can even go up to a girl and start talking, back in high school I would constantly be to dumb or anxious to realize a girl was hitting on me. One girl even sent me 100 nude pics and videos while we’re sitting in English class and I ended up doing nothing with her. Countless opportunities I’ve missed.

Im proud I’ve been at-least been able to hook up with and date a few girls that I’ve really liked but it’s been a long time now, going on 2 years without a hug or kiss or anything and I’m kind of losing my mind. 

I’ve tried benzodiazepines and other ssri medication and it doesn’t do anything. I’ve kind of just given up and gotten more depressed, people my age are getting married and having a family and I can get a date. What a joke. ","I’m not being a dick or anything but you do seem to be feeling sorry for yourself. 

Buck up your attitude and sort your head out. 

You could have easily been both ugly and anxious?

Some people are victims of acid attacks for example and are so ugly their own parents struggle to look at them. 

I get you have a little anxiety, I do too. 

But the woe is me attitude is miles out of touch with reality, grow a pair, tackle your anxiety and put yourself out there.

Fluoxetine,"I think I’m going to start taking 20mg of fluoxetine tomorrow.

I’ve been dealing with a swallowing/choking phobia for a few months now, and I am making progress but I keep falling back to struggling to eat every few weeks.

I am in therapy and my therapist supports my decision, but I am so incredibly anxious to start them in case they are not right for me and they do more harm than good.

Can anyone give me their positive experiences, or what I can expect in the first few days and weeks of taking this?

My phobia doesn’t stop me from still doing my daily tasks and I don’t suffer from depression or general anxiety, these are the reasons why I’m unsure if I actually need to start fluoxetine.

However I do have slight OCD tendencies as well as a bit of social anxiety, and a few other minor phobias I’d like to work through, so I’m hoping these could potentially also help in other areas of my life. ",,1753718343.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbk31d/fluoxetine/,Anxiety
Can a retreat really help you heal? I’m honestly surprised by what I felt (PPPD),"Hi everyone,

My name is Daniel, and I’ve been living with PPPD (Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness) for about 10 years now.  
It started after a major emotional trauma and turned into this constant mix of dizziness, imbalance, brain fog, anxiety, and sometimes depression. Traditional treatments never really worked for me long-term.

Last year, I went to a Kung Fu retreat in Japan, and honestly, it helped more than I expected.  
Breathing techniques (like belly breathing), mindful movement, and meditative focus gave me small but meaningful relief. It didn’t “cure” anything, but it helped quiet the chaos for a bit.

Now I’m considering going to a place called Rythmia Life Advancement Center in Costa Rica. It’s a healing retreat that uses plant medicine (ayahuasca), breathwork, movement, and holistic therapies to help people release trauma and reconnect with themselves.

But I’m nervous, and I’m hoping to hear from others:

**Has anyone with PPPD (or similar somatic/anxiety-related conditions) ever tried Rythmia or something like it?**

* Did it help or make things worse?
* Was there good medical/emotional support?
* Was the experience physically or emotionally overwhelming?

And even if you haven’t been to a retreat like that:  
**What kinds of non-medication approaches helped you the most?**  
Somatic work? Breathwork? Trauma-focused therapy? Anything that actually made a difference?

I know these conditions affect everyone differently, but I’m just trying to figure out if this is something worth pursuing.  
It’s a big emotional and financial commitment, and I don’t want to make things worse.

Thanks so much for reading. I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or just support.  
Wishing healing and peace to all of us going through this.",,1753704724.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbehra/can_a_retreat_really_help_you_heal_im_honestly/,Anxiety

Melanoma fears,"So I have this mole on my chest that I believe I've had for at least a year. Now I'm worried it's melanoma. It's bigger than the rest of my moles in that area but is otherwise circular. The thing is I've been looking at images of moles that seemed completely normal to me but then turned out to be melanoma so I'm now scared.

Has anyone had this fear? I am scared that I waited too long to get it looked at since melanoma is basically a death sentence within a few months. I don't see a dermatologist until December so it's a long wait.","I felt a small mass in my breast last year. There's a history of breast cancer in my family so it terrified me. I was able to be seen and examined within a week, but I was basically panicking while on the phone so they triaged me.

If you've noticed changes in appearance, itching, oozing/open sore, you may be able to also get into triage, especially if you emphasize how scared you are.

Or maybe try to see if there's somewhere else that has an opening sooner to be examined. || It’s good that you are seeing a dermatologist. You need a trained medical expert to diagnose it properly. Remember that the overwhelming number of moles, even large moles,  on a persons body are not cancerous. Melanoma is definitely not a death sentence within months. The survival time for late stage melanoma is five years, and that survival time has been improving dramatically with new treatments like immunotherapy. It is a form of cancer where new research is paying off. I have a good friend who is in their seventh year since her late stage melanoma was detected, and living her best life. Bottom line is that it is exceptionally unlikely that you have melanoma, and even if you were to have the worst form of melanoma, which is even more unlikely, the survival time is increasing. To calm your mind until December, try using guided meditation for anxiety, and controlled breathing exercises. You can find both on YouTube. I hope that you find peace of mind very soon. || Can you get in to another dermatologist earlier?  Waits are normal but that’s a really long time.",1753717139.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbjji0/melanoma_fears/,Anxiety
Could food have gotten into my lungs?,"Could food have gotten into my lungs?

Hey there
I was just eating a sour gummy ring yesterday evening and suddenly felt like one bit was moving or was about to move into the wrong tube, so I sprang up and spit out everything that was in my mouth.

Now, I can't tell if that particular bit that felt like it was moving down the wrong tube actually slid down the wrong tube or what happened to it. During the occurence I did not cough.

Why do I freeze when I have to make important decisions — even when all options are good?,"Last year, I got admission offers from around 10 good colleges and courses. But I became so confused and overwhelmed that I couldn’t decide at all. In the end, I didn’t choose any and ended up taking a drop year — just staying at home and doing nothing. I still regret that lost time.

This kind of thing doesn’t only happen with college decisions — it happens to me in many important areas of life. I overthink, get stuck, and end up doing nothing.

Why does this happen, and how can I overcome this kind of decision paralysis?
","1/ ask yourself ""what is truly important to me?"" - whatever comes to mind in the first second is the thing. And your main criteria. 

2/ write stories about how each option would help you get closer to the thing that you want. 

3/ pick the one that FEELS more natural. 


If I am right about how you think (and it seems like I am, because I used to be a chronic indecisive overthinker), you already know which option feels better. But you refuse to accept this option, because you believe you might be missing something, or because you don't trust yourself, or because you think you're making emotional decisions and it's not good. 

I used to struggle to make decisions. Some options would seem so attractive, but I'd hesitate - simply because I had a strong belief that WHATEVER I CHOOSE IS NOT THE RIGHT OPTION. 

I would rationalize, try to bully myself into choosing options that didn't feel good just to ""not choose emotionally"" (ironically, I would still choose emotionally, but I'd suffer). 

I was also worried that I would regret my choices. 

And I did for a while. 

But then I also realized that whenever I bullied myself into something, I wouldn't feel energetic and happy about it. And I'd fail for sure. But if I do something that feels good, I'll understand myself better, satisfy the itch, and I'd act with energy and enthusiasm and I may even win. 

No one knows the future, and we will all be dead. Why do things that don't feel authentic and right?!",1753716575.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbjan5/why_do_i_freeze_when_i_have_to_make_important/,Anxiety
A little reminder if you’re feeling anxious today💛,"
If your body’s feeling tense, or your mind won’t stop racing, or you’re feeling shut down—there’s nothing wrong with you.
Your body isn’t failing you. it’s actually doing what it thinks it has to do to keep you safe and functional. (Seeing it like this shifted everything for me) 

Even just pausing to feel your body—like really noticing where your breath is, or placing a hand on your chest or belly—can be enough to shift something.

You don’t have to fix it all today.
But your body is on your side. Even when it feels like too much.

Please help,I’m 23 about to be 24 is 24 old? I’m so scared I’m going to die soon it’s so scary turning 24 what can I do to not obsess over this ,"Therapy and meds are your best friend. Look at resources for death OCD || I had this, but mine was a classic mid life crisis. Happened when I turned 50. Kids left home, parents are aging. Everyone seems so much younger than me. Retirement seems scary as fuck, and it's closer to me than me starting my career. I'm scared that my life will be over soon. But Jesus, I'm only 50, I have so much more life. It's going to take some time for me to get used to this new life. 

I would give you this one piece of advices. I wouldn't worry, and I would stay off Reddit and every single social media app you use. Well, ok, that's two pieces. || 24 is in no way old, and trust me, you WILL be okay. it is VERY unlikely that you'll die from anything health-related or age-related, and you're *literally* the youngest you'll ever be! 
idk how you usually cope with anxiety, but what helps me to cope with these sort of thoughts is honestly just distracting myself until they go away - go for a walk, go grocery shopping, go shopping for clothes, go play video games, anything that'll get you distracted and take your mind off this. if you find that it persists, i'd honestly suggest you talk to someone close about it and try to make them understand what you feel and how you think - hopefully they'll reassure you that nothing bad will happen. i always feel better when i get reassurance from someone close to me, especially someone older. 

i really hope you find a succesful way to deal with this, bc i know how bad it can get. u got this! :) || I have many health problems and a disease that has no cure. And I know that my life expectancy is much lower than normal.

I have despaired many times about it. And the truth is that I cannot avoid it nor control it.

So between living in fear and then dying or living without fear and then dying, I prefer the second option. || Had the same crisis when I turned 25 a few months ago. It ended up snowballing into a huge ordeal. No you aren’t old. Relax || 24 is very young!!! Coming from a 17 year old, lol. I only think you start getting old when you hit 40. You have a long, long time. It’s very unlikely you’ll die soon. You’ll be alright. ❤️ || I turned 30 ten months ago. Was freaking out about it then but trust me, life goes on. I used to think I wouldn’t live past 26, now part of me feels I didn’t really start living until this past year.

Talk to some people who are older than you. You’ll find it’s pretty common that when you’re younger many people feel like “Omg I’m so old” because truthfully every single second of your life you are both the oldest you’ve ever been AND the youngest you’ll ever be again.

My advice (based on sometimes works for me): Stop taking life so seriously and start living for yourself, do the things that scare you (not because they’re adrenaline sports but because you’re worried you might fail), and maybe consider seeing a therapist. Both meds and talking to someone are great in the temporary or long term. || I’m 36. Still here even after cancer, which is pretty rare when you’re young. You’ll be alright. || No. I'm 35 
24 is not old
It's all about perspective
You could write down how you feel. Or self talk: ""it's ok that I feel this way but it's just a thought it doesn't make it true ""
I believe this is a quarter life crisis. I dyed my hair again for mine. Saying that I think we all have moments in our life we need to do something to feel good. Maybe you could write a list of fun things to do || I'm 21 obsessing over this too.
I think we need to relax but I don't really know how || you’re safe, you’re not going to die. meds have helped me a lot, but if that’s something you’re not comfortable with yet, u should 1000% talk to a therapist about this. you’re not alone, these types of thoughts aren’t rare. hope you feel better soon, remember to breathe. 💗💗 || You should look into transhumanism it's how I got over my fear of death. I am going to tell you something my ex told me when I had your fear. You are not going to die, you have many decades ahead of you plus scientists and AI are figuring out how to make death optional. They estimate that by 2027 humans will start to receive treatment. Your job is to get healthy to see that future. || Ugh, I’m having the same thing right now as I’m about to 27. Classic quarter life crisis. Suddenly I feel so old and like I’m running out of time. It’s really snowballing into a full on OCD thing about aging, death and just the passage of time in general. I had a similar crisis at age 17 as I entered adulthood, and that passed after a couple months, and I know this will pass too. It just sucks…but you can’t listen to your anxiety brain on this stuff. Anxiety lies to you and makes things seem terrifying that really aren’t. Aging is not scary! It’s normal, we’re all doing it constantly, and really it’s a gift. Ever new stage of life is sweet in its own way and has something new to offer. And if you look at people who actually are closer to death, like people in their 70s/80s, are they constantly miserable and terrified? No, most of them are happy and peaceful. || Imagine turning 25 💔 || This!!! I’m turning 24 next month. I’ve had generalized anxiety and depression and OCD since i was like 15. Never got diagnosed till this year. I started meds.(Zoloft) and have never felt SO GOOD!!! It’s genuinely life changing. Don’t be scared to reach out for help for your mental health. It’s the best thing i could have done for myself || Yes I’m having the same thing leading up to my 27th birthday. At first it was just that normal, mild pre birthday anxiety, “wow I’m getting older”, “that year really flew by”, but OCD took ahold of it and it turned into a vicious cycle and now I’m obsessing about age, time, all that. What helped you get through it? || I want to go and get on meds but I’m so scared that being on meds will make me die sooner because it’s something not natural going into you so I’m so scared of them turning my brain to mush || Literally same. Like 2 weeks before my birthday I started thinking about how I can’t believe I’m turning 25 and how fast time goes. Then it suddenly took a dark turn and i started obsessing about death and started having panic attacks even thinking about the concept of time and stuff. During my birthday dinner I was literally trembling and having obsessive and intrusive thoughts. It was terrible. Honestly nothing. It just passed with time. I want to say it took about 1.5 months for this “theme” to go away. Now when I think back to that crisis I’m left scratching my head in confusion as to what I was so worked up about…. || I thought the same thing - trust me. I have major health anxiety and thought I was going to die any day and it gave me so much anxiety. But at the end of the day stress and anxiety will kill you faster because of the toll it takes on your body. Don’t be scared to ask for help.

"Feeling of mixing up words, but not actually mixing them up?","I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to explain this but I’ll try my best.

Yknow when you’re excited or distracted or anxious, and you’re talking and going along your sentence, then you get this tugging feeling and realize something you said wasn’t quite right. You kinda subconsciously replay when you most recently said, and it takes you a moment to figure it out, but you realize you used the wrong word or completely mispronounced it, or cobbled together two words. 

I’m getting that feeling, that little tug in my brain saying “Oops, that didn’t quite sound right, let’s go back and fix that” but I haven’t said anything wrong or actually messed up my words. I’ll go back and repeat the sentence again like I’m correcting myself, but the sentence stays the same. I’ll even have a specific word that I feel like I messed up, but I’ll say it a few times and cannot find an alternative or cannot find the issue with the word. I’ll look at my partner, repeat the word, and ask him “Is that right? Am I saying that right?” And he’ll confirm, yup I said that completely normally. 

I am also sometimes genuinely messing up my words too. But I think a normal amount, especially a normal amount for me being anxious and on edge or ramble-y. I’m wondering if maybe my anxiety is making me fixate on the times I do mess up words, so I’m overanalyzing my sentences and finding errors in perfectly normal words and sentences? 

It’s a weird sensation and newer for me, started happening within the past week or two. It’s like I have the sensation of aphasia, I feel the frustration of not being able to get my words right and the confusion of them being scrambled, but I’m *not* actually messing them up.

Doing my best not to fixate on this. I know it doesn’t mean I have dementia or a brain tumor or anything lol. But it’s hard not to worry about it, I hate new and unusual feelings.",,1753714565.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbiemw/feeling_of_mixing_up_words_but_not_actually/,Anxiety
happy birthday to me…,"I had a big birthday dinner this past weekend, 14 of my family members and closest friends. (20+ year friendships). It’s hard to see each other often as life happens, so I always look forward to this time of year where we can catch up. Long story short, my (F36) male friend (M37), brought his new girlfriend. I had met this woman once before, over a year ago and don’t have much recollection of it other than we didn’t particularly “hit it off”. Just not someone I would choose to socialize with if I didn’t have to. However, I haven’t seen nor spoken this person; we really don’t know eachother whatsoever. And when he told me she would be joining him for my birthday dinner, I said ofcourse no problem. Late in the evening, after many cocktails and everyone else had left (friends, sisters, parents, extended family), this woman proceeded to tell me all the reasons why I’m not a good person and how she insists that her boyfriend (my friend of 20+ years) start to distance himself from me. I was so caught off guard, I was emotional and anxious beyond belief. This person doesn’t know me from a hole in the wall, and I reckon there’s an insecurity level on her part that makes her want to isolate my friend from any perceived “threats” to her new relationship. Regardless, I felt ambushed, it felt calculated, and I am hurt beyond words that my friend I’ve known since childhood just let her rip me to shreds. I’m tough and have had a lot of turmoil in my childhood that has made me quite “hard”, but the reality is I am extremely sensitive, in a constant fight or flight status and I care very deeply about my relationships. I’ve been through therapy, meditation, medication and all the right treatments to manage my anxiety over the years. This however has thrown me for a loop. I feel nauseous, I can’t sleep, I feel dizzy, I feel emotional, I feel like everyone hates me, that I’m a horrible person, that I’m alone. It physically hurts. I received an apology from the friend the next day, but I need to take some serious time to step back and reflect on how to proceed. Friendships change, life happens, but why come? Why attend the dinner? Just to see me hurt? I don’t think I’ll ever get it. But if anyone has been through something similar I’d love to hear how you coped. As a fellow chronic anxiety sufferer.

Diet tips,"Hello everyone,
diet is almost always mentioned as something that should be addressed when it comes to mental health, but there are so many kinds of diets out there, each claiming to be the healthiest. For those of you who overcame chronic anxiety or got significantly better, was diet a part of that and if so, how exactly did you adjust it?
The only thing I assume is alcohol, coffeine and sugar are not great for anxiety.",People say eating healthy makes you feel better but don't get drawn into faddy diets. Just eat a balance and you'll be fine. I feel like anxiety is caused by your mind and although being generally healthy is important for that it's not a cure or quick fix || Thank you!,1753713761.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbi1wd/diet_tips/,Anxiety
Does anyone else get nauseous/gaggy before practice but feel fine once you're there?,"Not trying to self-diagnose anything, but I wanted to see if anyone can relate to this.

I play American football and we just returned from a 2-week summer break. Before break, I’d already been struggling with intense anxiety before practice. I’d feel super nauseous, start gagging, and completely lose my appetite the whole day. But once I got to practice and warmed up, I felt completely fine like my body just calmed down and forgot the panic. Now that I’m going back after break, it’s hitting me again. I woke up at 7am and practice isn’t until 3:30pm but I already feel sick. That whole 8-hour window is just waiting, spiraling, and trying not to puke. And the thing is, I know from experience I’ll be fine once I’m there. But my body reacts like I’m going to die. It’s not just football either. I used to do jiu jitsu and had the same problem. I remember dreading it some days, gagging before class, and being too nauseous to eat or drink. Most of the time I showed up and calmed down eventually, but one day the anxiety got so bad I skipped. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t even move. And I think ever since then, my brain kinda panics and remembers that moment. I’m not afraid of the sport or getting hit. I just feel this dread about “what if I can’t calm down this time?” or “what if I gag in front of someone?” But it’s weird, because 99% of the time I show up, I’m okay. The anxiety’s just before not during. Has anyone else gone through this? I’m trying to rewire how I think about it and not give avoidance any power, but I wanted to know if this is something others deal with too. Any tips, stories, or mental tricks you’ve used would help.

Edit: My anxiety started when I was 10, and since then, I have trouble with my appetite, all because I get nauseous and anxious over the smallest things. I really need this appetite thing to just go away because I've been dealing with it ever since I started football like back in freshman year, and I'm surprised I'm still in football but this anxiety thing is so annoying ","When my anxiety first showed up when I was 11-17, I had trouble eating/swallowing all of the time but was utterly unbothered when I played sports, which I was doing year round with different teams. 


That was a long time ago for me and I have different issues now, but still yes, it goes away when I'm 'busy' especially with other people. I'm afraid my anxiety will ruin a party, but the party makes it tone way down or go away. 


I don't think I have any tips; I've been reading DARE, so I'm trying to put that into practice by thinking to myself that I want my symptoms to get worse in the moment (and of course they don't). You should look into the book yourself, but I think it's great that you're still playing and putting yourself in situations your anxiety wants to be uncomfortable, not letting it rule your life.  || Thanks for this commenting bro, and it really helps to hear someone else describe something so similar. That part you said about anxiety disappearing when you're ""busy,"" I get that. It's exactly how it plays out for me too!


I haven’t read DARE yet but I’ve heard of it. The part about wanting symptoms to get worse actually makes a lot of sense like it feels like the exact opposite of what my brain wants me to do. I’ve been avoiding the anxiety buildup for so long that maybe leaning into it is what I’ve been missing.


Appreciate the insight. Mind if I ask how you practiced that “want it to get worse” mindset when you first started? || I'm still reading it so haven't had too much practice. But for example, I have issues with a tight throat, so it starts happening and I get nervous and I literally say to myself, ""can't you (anxiety/brain) make this worse?"" And I picture a balloon expanding in my throat or a string being tightened around it. The thought is that you're showing your nervous system that you are not afraid of these symptoms and there's no reason to keep escalating your stress/adrenaline. 
It's important to remember that if it was a real medical emergency, just willing your heart to go faster would not do anything. 
And so far I'm having shorter bouts with those really awful moments. 
Still trying to sit tight with the lower level anxiety that hangs around. || That actually sounds a lot like ERP, is it based on the same principle? You're basically triggering the feared sensation and refusing to run from it, which I’ve heard is key in exposure work. My father taught me something about ERP when I was much younger, and I do my best to practice it but to this day I still don't quite understand much.


I like the example of picturing the balloon or string and it’s weirdly smart how leaning into the sensation instead of fighting it makes it lose power. Have you noticed it helping outside of that tight throat feeling too? ",1753713480.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbhxf4/does_anyone_else_get_nauseousgaggy_before/,Anxiety

Light headed all night,"Back story: going on week 4 of not getting enough sleep (lucky if I get 4 hours straight) Been dealing with anxiety/panic attack symptoms (due to grief) lately plus my 7 month old baby is teething.

All I do is wakeup work and fixate on how messed up everything is including medication management,This world is falling apart doctors pulling scripts from patients when the medicine is needed. Benzos have been deamonized and gaba drugs have been used in place. I never had this issue when I was on them as a child. All it's doing is working me up everyday. Anyone else have this issue ? I'm getting white coat syndrome over it,"It's pretty bad to be on a medicine and then have to worry about a doctor refusing to prescribe it anymore. It happens a lot especially at MH clinics where there is frequent staff turnover. Same thing happened with pain killers. Now people that really do need them are denied or shamed as drug seeking.   
Even if you are responsible and aware of the risks of benzos it's hard to not be affected by all the negativity. If it's a choice of dependence on a benzo vs. crippling anxiety what is the problem? People are dependent on all kinds of drugs to be healthy.

Facial tension - struggling to accept the physical impact of anxiety,"For the past month I’ve had terrible facial tension. At first I thought sinus infection, then TMJD, then allergies, now I’m stressed it’s a dental infection… it seems to flare up for a while, simmer down if I’m gentle and take my mind off it and then come back at full force. It sucks, I have pain in my jaw, teeth, eyes, sinuses, and forehead. I think it is the physical strain of poor posture and bracing my jaw for the past month all coming out. I just had a bad spiral, telling myself it could be an infected tooth, and even from that I can feel my shoulders and cheeks tense up more.

How do you actually manage to “accept” physical symptoms are caused by anxiety and curb the cycle of pain -> worry -> examine -> more pain? Some days I can step back and say “it’s anxiety. I’ll just take some pain killers and give it a day” and then next day I’m almost in tears from stress. ","it’s good that you been talking to yourself, definitely keep doing that and reminding yourself this is all anxiety. it took me a long long time to accept my physical symptoms are anxiety (and sometimes i still struggle with this) so know you’re not alone. i recommend this book called “hope and help for your nerves” by claire weekes. it explains whats going on in your body when you’re experiencing anxiety/panic attacks. it really helped me accept my physical symptoms as anxiety and it was also a good distraction || Understanding and recognizing if your physical symptoms were caused by your anxiety spirals or something up with your actual body is sort of a long road. A specific anxiety loop; hypochondria. Like only over the course of years struggling with some of the worst anxiety times do you get to a point where you can define it with confidence, since anxiety automatically makes you question stuff you logically know. The truth you don’t wanna accept (at least speaking for myself and maybe you or others with anxiety who can relate) is that it’s very likely at least 80% of what you feel that is off in your body might be caused by anxiety especially if you’ve been struggling for a stretch of time with something triggering. It’s exhausting sometimes to even define triggers cause they can be small and seem so silly and insignificant. Newsflash: nearly by definition GAD is not anxiety or stress that is warranted so it doesn’t have to make sense at all. I found it helpful to, even if it was a tiny thing, acknowledge anything that up ticked my anxiety. Don’t purposely overanalyze each moment, but when you feel a real shift in how calm and safe you feel, make a mental note and label the reason. I find it can give the thing less power sometimes. And next time you’ll know this stresses me out sometimes and you catch onto it quicker. I find it helps me to at least take it less seriously and understand I might feel X,Y,Z (insert common bodily symptom of anxiety I’ve felt before after feeling anxious) it may still be stressful to feel and the underlying stress might not disappear, but you become more tolerant and are less likely to build and intensify your fearful thoughts into bigger monsters. It sort of cuts it off before it grows bigger, before the idea runs wild in your anxious brain that loves coming up with worst case scenarios. Give yourself grace! I get caught up feeling frustrated that I’m so anxious over nothing and everyone around me must be judging, thinking “she doesn’t really have any problem she’s just making herself worried sick”, but it’s not nothing, not to an anxious person, and it’s also not necessarily something seriously wrong either. It will pass when we are able to think clearly and feel peace again. However long that may take. It’s just how anxiety works. It’s going to be totally okay! And our bodies are so much stronger and capable to healing than we realize! Take more time to do things that can help even if they don’t work in the moment, it’s good to do something and focus on distraction or some sort of manageable and healthy coping strategy you like to use. || Botox in my masseters because a clenched jaw is just part of my life. || It’s really reassuring to hear this. I bought that book about a week ago and the explanation of how our body gets so flighty and can take a while to actually turn that reaction down was so helpful to even taking that first step. I think distraction is also a big part of getting better too. || yes! distraction is definitely a huge part. getting up and going for walks is so healing for me. hope you feel better soon, remember you’re not alone :)",1753671577.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb556i/facial_tension_struggling_to_accept_the_physical/,Anxiety

I wake up more tired then when I go to sleep. I can't fucking stop thinking. I'm SO exhausted but at the same time my whole body is full of this energy I can't seem to shake. I fucking CAN'T STOP THINKING AND LOOPING OVER AND OVER AGAIN with all these anxious thoughts that it will never get better. I'm constantly tring to find solutions and fix everything. I'm such a fucking mess man. It's to the pathetic point that I want to punch shit and crash out but I'm literally afraid to do that because I'm scared I'll crash the next days even harder. Wtf is even the point. I'm trying to see the light but I just can't man. I have so so so much love and patience in my heart but I can't take all of it anymore. My brain is so overstimulated that I can't even follow a normal conversation anymore. I barely leave the fucking house because when I'm not with my face in my monitor or phone screen I get hit with 24/7 DPDR. Reading all this stuff about ignoring it and it going away on its own, that sounds so lovely but I've been trying for two fucking years. I wanna cry constantly BUT I CAN'T. I tried everything man, everything. I'm still in therapy btw. I just can't go on like this. I'm only 23 and my life used to be so fucking good compared to what it has been now for the last couple years. I came to a point I'm disgusted at myself. A month ago I was reading a lot into buddhism and actually bettering my life and now here I am back again, so unbelievable mad at the world and the stupid state it and my brain is in. Everything in my just wants to grab the alcohol and benzo's but I know I will never do that bullshit because ultimately I know I'll be far worse off. I'm just so tired from all the fighting man, and being forced by my own goddamn brain to THINK THINK THINK, SOLVE, SOLVE, SOLVE. I hate the fact that I'm too fucking intelligent to constantly be aware of any danger in my life and trying to solve it or prevent it, and yet too fucking dumb to just simply STOP while I completely understand that all this 'fixing' behaviour is what is self sabotaging me to the point it's destroying me and every aspect of my life. It is to a point where my therapist doesn't know what to do anymore because after two years of CBT I already master all the thinking patterns and know how to think and how not to think, I just can't fucking do or apply it. Why me man, fucking dumb ass world. I'm so done always being the hopeful good guy, I'm so fucking done being the patient guy, I'm so fucking done being the guy that pretends everything is all good meanwhile I'm fighting a battle of life and death EVERY.

I swear the god dude if my brain was an actual person I'd beat the hell out of it and punch it until my fist be bleeding or I'm in handcuffs. And no, I'm not a violent person, in the 23 years on this shitty earth I never layed hands on someone. And no, I'm not a danger to anyone or even myself, because I know damn well that I'm both too pussy to unalive myself and made a deal with myself that I'll just live with my pain until I'm old hoping it gets better so I won't transfer a different pain onto my family and friends. Besides all the fucking issues with myself, the world is fucking ugly. Everybody is so egotistical. People are inhumane only caring about themselves and doing everything to fuck over people who really need help more and more. The ""best"" country in the world where the people living in it vote for a narcisistic raper and alleged pedophile who does everything to make one of our worlds biggest problem bigger, called capitalism.

Anyone successfully use Pregablin for GAD/Panic attacks?,"Tldr: On paper, Pregablin seems more effective than my current Gabapentin for GAD/Panic. Any first hand experiences?

Hi everyone,

I'm on a taper of Valium that I was prescribed for over two years @ 30mg (3x 10mg daily) and although I've been stuck at 5mg x2 a day for about a month I presume my psych will start the taper again today. I was prescribed Gabapentin 600mg 4x daily to help combat the rebound anxiety and panic, the GAD in general too.

My question is this: the gabapentin does notably do something for my generalized anxiety, that's for sure. But it doesn't help in the slightest for my panic attacks. While researching, I discovered a similar medication called Pregablin and it seems to indicate it's a better medication overall for my GAD/Panic, such as much quicker onset, lower risk of withdrawal, etc. 

Does anyone have any experience with Pregablin? I certainly intend on bringing this up with my psych today but I'd like some first hand experiences if possible. Thanks!",,1753711643.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbh5d5/anyone_successfully_use_pregablin_for_gadpanic/,Anxiety
Selective mutism,"tw venting

On a normal day I don't really remember I have selective mutism, because I'm so used to it. Which is weird, because I know I can't speak properly and there are plenty of situations that should remind me of SM, but at the same time I don't think about the diagnosis despite it all. Because when I do remember, such as right now, it makes me feel paralyzed. Suddenly, I also remember so many situations where people started seeing me as a person only after we have been chatting online.

One instance was at a daycare clinic theee years ago where I was talking to a guy from the clinic 24/7 for two weeks (we both had covid), and when we saw each other at the clinic, he was actually so excited to see me, was constantly talking to me, and it's so shameful, but it's veeeery rarely the case that someone acts this way with me. He then noticed my lack of mimic, gesticulation, and that I'm just not rlly saying anything and stopped. It's hella weird, but we then never spoke for those 8h at the clinic for three whole months; but every single day, once we were both in the car, we started texting till the late evening. And we never talked about it. My SM, how strange it is and so on. Actually, I made four ""friends"" this way at that clinic, and I only talked to them in person when we were alone, because I physically can't when there's a second person in the room.

Before my stay at that clinic and after that, there have been plenty of similar situations. Over text, I mostly feel okay about myself. It's not me at all, but the real me never had a chance to develop, but I can at least get my point across, I can be understood to some degree, I can show humor etc. (btw, English is not my native language, so - sry) I'm not devaluing myself or calling myself empty, just stating the facts. Now I have a new therapist, she's friendly, cool, challenging, sadly classist and sometimes drops nasty phrases (not about me), but corrects herself if she notices.

At the age of 19, my hopes are still up that my SM might improve, but I still don't have a support system whatsoever. Slowly, it's getting veeeery noticeable that I'm far behind, after having spent my formative years in my four walls. Others my age move out, go to uni, travel and so on, and I am going back to 11th grade to repeat my a-levels. (I dropped out a year ago) Some things have changed - I got diagnosed with AuDHD, am medicated relatively well - for my depression and ocd, I can talk to my parents in public, school will be partly online, I am better at a few small things; but what comes after school? And what comes now?

I want to talk to people, but my head is spinning, and I feel like throwing up when I only think about it. What really ruined me was a 10 month long ldr relationship that ended like 16 months ago. When we met after like seven months, it was the same thing over again just like with this guy from the clinic. We also never talked about me being mostly mute. He didn't treat me any different after really experiencing me being mute (I told him, but ig he didn't know how to deal with it which I understand). I broke up with him a few months later, because I felt like it was cruel of me to stay in this relationship. It was as if I'm catfishing. And even I convinced myself that the catfish is real.

I have tried plenty of things to ground myself, improve my mental health, such as sports and journaling, but I really really want to be a proper part of this society and fit in. At least find my people, even a few irl. I quit my second job after two weeks (the first one after two weeks as well, even tho I wanted to work and still do) cause of bullying. There was a guy who was testing everyone, and you had to ""protect yourself"" verbally. When he noticed how quiet I am, he started making remarks constantly (don't wanna elaborate, doesn't matter) and has been throwing cardboard boxes at me. The boss was so much worse. What did I do?

1. I managed to say sth once, but it wasn't enough and didn't change anything for me.
2. I reported the boss for her bullying via email. What I'm trying to say: I almost always go over to written communication which one could see not as a weakness, but rather a solution-oriented approach or whatever, but still - I don't want it to be my life. 

Also, I don't know how the hell I managed to do it, but there have been so many health- and finance-related things which I sorted/figured out by myself over the span of the past year where I have been out of school. 2-3 appointments every single week which might sound sick. Sometimes, those appointments were unsuccessful due to SM, but more often than not I was successful. My parents always refused to help me, cause they have no understanding and never bothered. I almost always brought notes with me or rlly tried to choke out the words. My anxiety improved in general (very slightly). It's still just as scary to speak, but less frightening to be. It's a small win, but still.",,1753711631.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbh56r/selective_mutism/,Anxiety

Sometimes things look like they’re going in a positive direction from the outside, but we struggle internally. When things start looking up, there are new challenges, hopes, and fears. I have found a few things helpful. First, I journal about what is going on in my life, both externally and emotionally. Often writing it down can help to clarify what we’re feeling, and why. We can get an internal dialogue going. I also use guided meditations every day. If I’m feeling anxious, I use a meditation for anxiety.

They have tools and modules to help navigate life’s inevitable highs and lows. Just because things seem to be looking up doesn’t mean your mental health is looking up.

feel lost after a severe panic attack... I just need someone to listen,"I'm a young man in my twenties. Not long ago, I went through a strange and shocking experience.

It sounds like in your case the mix of all that caffeine triggered your panic attack. It’s normal to feel scared of this new crazy sensation but I want to assure you…A panic attack WILL NOT kill you. It’s really scary but you won’t die from a panic attack. It’s just a huge amount of adrenaline going through your body when you least expect it so the intensity and randomness immediately creates fear. Having coffee and an energy drink isn’t a good idea for your heart in general. Maybe keep it to just coffee and go back out there…fake it till you make it. You’ll feel off for a little while and then it will slowly go away the more you get back into a rhythm again. Act fact though, do not let your nervous system develop too much fear over that one panic attack. You got this! || This same thing happened to me back in 2020, right before lockdown. Needless to say it intensified once the pandemic began. It lasted around 9 months, probably longer than usual due to said circumstances. This is a very common struggle after a panic attack, and I can assure you that you will feel okay again. You will habituate to the anxiety and fear will stop controlling you. It takes patience and acceptance. Try not to engage into the fear and not check anything health-related. Also keep yourself busy and socialize even when your mind tells you not to. Overthinking is useless and so damaging. You got this! || You live in constant fear and stress fearing that traumatic event can happen again at any moment.

My life never returned to normal after my first panic attack and I had to resort to taking SSRIs which helped and are helping.

This shit sucks 😞 || I’m currently going threw this from a panic attack last month and I just can’t get bk to feeling normal and it gives me that trapped feeling and then I get more scared that I’m not gonna be myself again. || I'm a young woman. stress has caused me to be dizzy, have double vision and breathlessness. or mimics of heart attacks. so i get you. || I’ve had this trigger as well. Needless to say, incredibly intense. Without fail, if I would take a shot of Espresso, the next day while showering my heart rate would go to 185+. All of the symptoms you’ve described and then some.

Overstimulated the amygdala with caffeine, triggered a cataclysmic fight-or-flight response. Now your subconscious is derealizing as a defense mechanism. None of this is permanent, but it can perpetuate indefinitely unless you repattern the signals by learning how to be unreactive to the fear and discomfort. || Went through this and still seriously struggling, going on almost 2 years now. I am definitely not the same person. || Yes this happened to me 2020 but was weed induced panic attack. I think it emerged into a panic disorder and was always anxious when the next panic attack will happen. With medication and therapy I got back to former self within 6-8 months. I went through a separation with my wife and another panic attack made my panic disorder come back. I’m hopeful with medication and therapy again I can get myself back again . If I can do it once I can do it again . There is always hope ! || you should try nba 2k || Thank you so much for sharing your experience. It really helps to know I’m not alone and that someone else went through something very similar. I’m curious, what kind of doctor did you see for your panic attacks and the tests? I haven’t started medication yet, but I’m considering it because I want to feel more balanced. Your story gives me hope that things can get better over time. || Yes, it’s been 10 days and I swear I’ve felt like I’m dying every day. It’s been really hard on my mind and heart. But honestly, your words gave me some comfort. They made me feel like someone understands me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. || Thank you for sharing. If you don’t mind me asking, what kind of doctor did you see? And how did you get started with the SSRIs? Did a general doctor prescribe them or a psychiatrist؟ || I know exactly how you feel. I went through something similar and I’m still trying to feel normal again. It’s tough, especially that “trapped” feeling. I really hope this goes away for both of us, and that we can feel that peace we used to have again.💚 || I feel you. Stress really does crazy things to the body. I’ve also had moments where I thought something was seriously wrong, but it was anxiety. You're not alone we’ll get through this 💛 || Wow, that sounds really intense… I can totally relate, especially the part about caffeine triggering everything. It’s crazy how something as small as coffee can set off such a powerful reaction in the body.
I didn’t know about the amygdala being overstimulated  that actually explains a lot.
Thanks for sharing this, it makes me feel a bit less alone in what I’m going through. I really hope I can learn to be less reactive too… still working on that part. || Really || I just went to my family Dr that I have always gone to. I've never had any issues like this in the past, but he was very understanding and proactive in medication. I feel like my attack lasted probably 2 weeks before I felt some what ""normal."" || Ofcourse! Thankfully that’s one of the beauties of this community…you sort of never feel alone in how you feel or manage or understand anxiety and panic. I’m glad I could bring you a little comfort the way others have brought me comfort. || Initially after my first attack I kept researching and doing some light bloodwork like cholesterol panel and trying to regulate my schedule, eating more healthy be more careful in general but I still felt bad in general and had like a panic attack per couple of months, that wasn't very bad but still. Eventually after about an year I said enough is enough and went to my family doc that is a heart surgeon aswell and told him my symptoms and stuff, afterwards he sent me for full bloodwork/urine& ECG and all of them were clear. 

So fast forward I was still feeling bad, and he suggested me to take Sertraline I got the prescription but I was trying not to take them but eventually i couldn't stand feeling like shit anymore and I had to see if sertraline would work, so I went for a very small dose (25mg)

For the first few days it got much worse but I knew this is how it works with SSRIs but after about 2 weeks I've seen improvments and after few months I feel much better I kept my low dose tho. I still have shitty days but it's manageable.

2 years after the first panic attack and I never felt the same like before, you become overconcerned, stressed hypochondriac etc, I wonder if upping my dose to 50mg which is the regular dose would make further improvement but my plan was always to eventually get off them.",1753654898.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mazd30/feel_lost_after_a_severe_panic_attack_i_just_need/,Anxiety
When i leave my house it's chaos,"Hii everyone. So i have obvious symptoms for agoraphobia cuz when i leave my house i get panic attacks. Now, i have been struggling with this for five years and i got really close to absolutely not care when I'm outside BUT recently i had surgery and i had to recover. So that means i didn't leave my house for about a month. A symptom of my anxiety, apart from dizziness and hard breathing, is needing to go to the bathroom. When I'm outside i am constantly worried that there is no bathroom in sight. And when i go on public transport MAN it's really bad. At this point i don't know what to do. I'm on medication and i did all the therapy jazz but it didn't help all that much. eds work sometimes. If anyone has a similar problem please tell me what do u do. ","try downloading the app ""flush toilet finder & map"" it shows you toilets/bathrooms nearby to where you are and also shows if they're accessible, need a key etc || Great suggestion!

What is this anxiety called?,"I always feel something in my intestines, in the stomach, particularly in the morning or before stressful situations. It's feels slightly like I am always sick and will throw up. It's really bad. How is this particular type of anxiety called and what is the cure, because I don't feel it anywhere except in the gut. ","I wouldn’t say the stomach issues are a particular “type” of anxiety, this is just how your body manifests your anxiety. Some people get light headed, dizzy, sweaty, have digestive issues, or all of the above. The type of anxiety more relates to what triggers the anxiety and the symptoms that come with it. || But if It manifests in the gut I would think it makes sense to take care of the gut more || You can do certain things to settle your stomach, but you need to ultimately treat the root cause of the issues too (the anxiety). There’s lots of resources online with grounding techniques and other advice, but you should probably speak to a doctor if it persists",1753691770.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbasu4/what_is_this_anxiety_called/,Anxiety
B12 deficiency trigger ?,"This may be a long post....I appreciate any advice.
Around 3 months ago I started getting allover body tingling, which was terrifying, I was too scared to even look it up. I have a chronic dental abcess which I'm awaiting sedation for and I thought it could be something to do with that but it seems most likely to be b12 deficiency.  The tingling turned into pins n needles, numbness, feeling dizzy , loss of sensation in skin, fuzzy feeling in arms and legs. I was so scared, I barely got out of bed for weeks. This left me feeling more unsteady and generally awful. After researching. I started taking methylcobalamin 6000mcg daily, along with Benfotiamine, b complex , cod liver oil, vit d and magnesium glycinate.  I managed to get a blood test which gave me b12 lv 534 but this was after supplementing.  My physical symptoms have vastly improved, it's just numbness mainly in arms and face now and occasional twitching. 
I have a drs apt today over the phone because I'm too anxious to go in! My anxiety and depression has ramped up due to this experience and I think also due to the sublingual methylcobalamin,  which I've now stopped taking and gone for 1000mcg cyanocobalamin instead. But since this, my anxiety has been awful. I've had periods before where I've been a bit agoraphobic but propranolol always sorted me out. But now I'm barely leaving the house and having thoughts of derealisation,  I've read this can be caused by b12 deficiency and also by methylcobalamin. I've been pushing myself to go on little walks and go in shops, if only for 10 mins or so, just to prove it's ok. But I'm so bored of being in my house and not doing anything. I find myself just sitting with the tv on for background noise, whilst I either scroll or talk to chat gpt. I have some sertraline I was prescribed last year but have never dared to take it due to side effects,  wondering if it will make me feel worse but I'm wondering if I should try. I just want my old self back. It's even harder that I barely ever see anyone, don't have many friends or family. ","we are in such similar situations it's crazy lol, im sat with my citalopram right now scared to take it. i will say though, you can't know unless you take the leap and try the medication. it could work and it may not, there's always more options. i started sertraline two years ago, that didn't work for me so started on citalopram and that seemed to work ok! stupidly stopped taking it now i'm back in a hole lol. if you need someone to talk to then just send me a dm :) also for the b12: nutritional yeast is great! || Hey,

 thanks for your reply. How did the sertraline feel for you? I've been advised by my GP to wait until after I finish my b12 injections to try sertraline, I'm hoping the injections will sort me out but already 'anxiety' ing about going to get them. I've been thinking of trying nutritional yeast as I don't eat much meat and am a former vegetarian || the sertraline made me feel super spaced out and like i wasn't even a person lol but it's different for every person! has the doctor prescribed them for anxiety? mine were for depression but now i am on citalopram for anxiety. i have heard vitamin deficiencies can mess u up a lot, i was also low on my b12 and folic acid a few months ago as i have been vegan for 8 years, i've got the levels back up now but still have major anxiety so gonna try the citalopram. you should definitely try the nutritional yeast, if your tastebuds like it you can put it on pretty much any foods lol. fingers crossed the injections do sort u out and even if they don't there's no harm or shame in trying other medication :) || That's the kind of feeling I'm trying to avoid 😩
i think they prescribed them for both depression/anxiety. I have family who are on sertraline and citalopram and they're ok with them. I was so shocked learning about b12 deficiency i had no idea what the symptoms were etc. How are you doing now? || regarding the b12 deficiency, the last blood test i had showed my levels were 263. i think i definitely have symptoms of b12 deficiency still but my GP is terrible and won't do anything about it so i'm just getting some supplements myself! not sure if you're in the UK but maybe it's worth a try also getting tested to see if you have a vitamin D deficiency || I'm in the UK too. I'm currently taking high strength D3 but could be that too. If you're getting b12  supplements I really recommend avoiding methylcobalamin if you have anxiety, I'm sure that it ramped mine up.

what are some of the worst physical anxiety symptoms yall have or have had?,,"Feeling faint everything  make me feel like its gonna happen I feel dizzy off balance and my vision get blurry etc || the tremors, chest pains and tbh diarrhea. || It’s hard to explain but it feels like I’m going to have a stroke. Just the weirdest, scariest sensation. Also derealization is horrible too || Sometimes if my anxiety gets really really bad- like constant panic attack bad- I’ve gone into full body shock where I literally cannot move my hands and they go numb and lock in the position that they’re in. Literally rushed myself to the ER for it- they did all these scans to make sure it wasn’t something else- gave me Ativan and boom I felt fine. 

So yeah definitely going into shock because I’m so worked up. Or depersonalization- when my body or limbs don’t feel like they belong to me- they’re heavy and kind of numb. My vision feels hazy too when it happens- like I’m not really in my body. || Chronic fatigue and nausea so much that feels like food poisoning all damn day || Severe vomiting and diarrhea, which sucks, but the dehydration that follows is definitely the bigger worry. I’m lucky to be able to afford mobile IV services when I need them. || Pain and tension in my chest.  It sounds like a mild one but I am soooo fuckin tired of it. || Throwing up

Best medication for panic and anxiety that’s not an ssri,I can not take ssri with my gene 🧬 type ,"Propanol. (A beta-blocker). It's a game changer. || HydrOXYzine or Buspirone. Buspirone (Buspar) is the closest to acting like an SSRI without actually being one. || I agree with benzos and beta blockers............bisoprolol/ativan || Having a Valium in your wallet at all times. || This is just my personal experience but:

klonopin-- works well, 0.5 mg is calming pretty quickly, larger doses obviously are more sedating

buspar-- did nothing for me but made me feel dizzy when I took a higher dose 

ativan-- not as good as klonopin in my opinion; similar but not as effective for me personally 

valium-- very calming but also very sedating/makes me sleepy

hydroxyzine-- similar to benadryl, but a a dose large enough to actually work made me feel sick but sedated 

xanax-- works very quickly, but extremely sedating 

propranolol-- did nothing for me, but I've never had physical anxiety that bad, so it might work better for people with that type   

benadryl-- obviously not a prescription med but it knocks me out 

I think what you should take depends on what anxiety symptoms you have, like if it's mainly panic attacks vs mainly generalized anxiety. Also the dose makes a BIG difference with any of these in how effective they are. || Exercise and meditation. L-theanine + GABA || Hydroxyzine || Magnesium gummies have been a life changer for me and I suffer from bad anxiety. It takes awhile but it definitely helps || I'm in the same situation yet they keep suggesting them or srni. It's like if I was allergic to chocolate and they offer me a Reese's. So tired of it all. || Goodluck as I have been praying for relief and only Klonopin helps me but I thank God for the Drs helping me || A puppy or two || Don't mean to hijack the thread but what do you guys think about metoprolol? I was just prescribed this a week or so ago for elevated heart rate and BP. I also suffer from anxiety. I'm feeling a little reserved on trying it out. Thoughts? || Ativan .5 || buspirone || It will make it worse before it gets better… but Wellbutrin || After three years of SSRIs and various other meds, I was finally given Marplan, an MAOI. This pretty much eradicated the panic attacks and agoraphobia in a week.

MAOIs get a bad rap that isn't really deserved. An Australian psydoc, Ken Gillman, has an excellent site with plenty of MAOI info. || Hydroxyzine does nothing for me. Currently started Zoloft (why so many against SSRIs) and I supplement with Xanex. If I don’t take Xanex before bed I don’t sleep. It is a fight to get them however. || Propranolol genuinely saved my life. It’s technically a beta-blocker but it cushions the physical symptoms of anxiety and, to me, that helps tremendously. || Benzos work quite well for an overwhelming majority of people.  However, you should talk to your doctor, as they are not for everyone. People with history of addiction problems or addictive personalities in general should avoid them.

as for which one... Each one hits each person differently.  Xanax turned out to be the one that worked best for me.  Other people swear by Klonipin or Ativan.. 

But, again, they are not for everyone! || Hydroxyzine maybe?",1753644047.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mav0i2/best_medication_for_panic_and_anxiety_thats_not/,Anxiety
Relapse After 3 Years Without Panic/Anxiety – Just Need to Vent,"Hey everyone — I lost my old account, but I posted here about 4 years ago sharing my anxiety journey.

I had been doing really well — no panic attacks, no major anxiety symptoms for about 3 years. But this past Wednesday, something changed. I noticed a painful lump growing in my armpit, and of course, I made the classic mistake: I Googled it. Found the worst-case scenarios, and that sent me spiraling. I ended up having a full-blown panic and anxiety attack. It was brutal — my wife even said I looked pale and ghost-like.

I had to wait until Friday to see a doctor, and those two days felt like a nightmare. Constant worry, racing thoughts, barely any sleep. Finally, the doctor told me it was just an abscess and prescribed antibiotics. Physically, I’m feeling much better now. 🫡

But mentally? I feel wrecked. That wave of stress and fear completely drained me. Even now I still feel on edge, like I’m in “alert mode.” Friday night was the first time I slept decently all week, but the exhaustion is still lingering.

This isn’t exactly new territory for me, but after years of relative peace, it hit hard. Just wanted to share in case anyone else has had a setback like this — it feels surreal to go through it again.

Thanks for reading.
","Been there. Had made tremendous progress since 2020. Never been on any medication, but i have anxiety issues since i was little kid (overthinking, probably mild adhd that went undiagnosed/maybe GAD/oversensitive  - it kind of runs in our family). 

Got massively in shape, doing all kind of sports (jogging/running, long walks/hikes, swimming, strength exercise). Lost great amount of fat, gained muscles, feeling better than in my 20s (Well, I'm in much better shape now). 2023 to first half of 2024 went absolute great. No panic attack, no major anxiety episode, was able to hit my limits again. 

Then we had a kid in 2024 and you can imagine what impact that has. Have to say, I enjoy it very much but even for me as a father it's draining as hell. I'm trying to be there for every minute, help with anything and everything I can. Keeping house in check and clean. Working hard to provide everything and stuff. But the episodes of little/bad sleep just overwhelmed me and it spiraled quickly. Suddenly couldn't tolerate high intensity exercises again (Simply because any sustained activity over 150bpm will bring even more anxiety) - so had to slow down, but that's fine - I can build up back again. 

As the time went it got worse and worse and boom, suddenly heart palpitations came back, sleep become very non-refreshing and i started to feel social anxiety again(Went to concert and had to leave before the end as I simply couldn't tolerate so much people around).   
  
One thing that helped me tremendously was the fact I went through all of that before and I knew I can overcome it. Luckily it settled down now in the summer, kid started to sleep in predictable patterns and i could give my mind a bit of well needed rest. After few weeks I literally felt like i was born again. I got one week straight of great overnight sleeps and felt energized. 

One thing tho is that I basically feel in my entire body that I'm still in state of heightened awareness as that's how it is with kid. Now it helped tremendously that we are trying to give ourselves a much more me-time with my GF as one of us simply take care of little one for almost whole day and the other goes and does whatever he pleases. It helped us both tremendously to relax and recharge a bit. So digging out of this for second time and I must say - It is easier this time, because I MADE IT BEFORE! 

So keep it up. You been there, you overcame it, you can do it again! || Thanks!!! And yeah! That has been working for me too, I have family, my wife and a kiddo! And they're super understanding about it.

But this time just got me off guard! I feel better today! Thank you so much for your positive words!",1753680096.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb7r6s/relapse_after_3_years_without_panicanxiety_just/,Anxiety
Heart palpitations over.. minecraft/nonscary games? Anyone else?,"Does anyone else experience this first of all? 

It sounds so silly, but I get physical reactions from anxiety while playing minecraft of all things.

It’s stupid because I know logically that it isn’t scary, but my body reacts like I’m getting physically chased.

However I use to go to work mid rolling panic attack and have to deal so I’m seasoned. Anxiety is all about doing shit despite being anxious and creating new and healthier brain pathways honestly. It’s when you make the anxiety the most important thing that it takes over because you’re reinforcing it’s important, loud and should be there running the show. I cured my own panic disorder on my own no help or meds so I can kind of get through any anxiety now after that absolute fuckin’ hellscape I was living. But really if you let it take drivers seat it will continue to drive. Realize you’re safe anyway and live your life.

A chronic fear I can't figure out,"So im constantly anxious that people around me that I care about are going to die, it's debilitating and I can't seem to get through it

And God forbid they get sick even with just a mild cold or allergies and then I'm horribly anxious about it and can't sleep or eat. I get shaky and can't focus on anything all I can worry about is if they're okay and they usually get annoyed at me for checking on them constantly over the sniffles..

I try my best to use my coping mechanisms but I can't focus enough for them to work, I try grounding exercises and it doesn't work like it does when I'm trying to cope with other things 

This rule also applies when I'm sick, I'm constantly washing my hands till they're dry and cracking because I'm scared of getting sick and dying

does anyone else experience this? I can't get into therapy right now I don't have insurance, I just wanna know what other people think or if they've experienced it how they coped?","Yeah. The same thing happens to me. I am afraid that my relatives will die and that I will too. 
But you have to know that it is normal, that feeling has allowed us to survive for thousands of years. What you feel is the sense of protection towards you and your family, your fear is a natural mechanism of your body to take care of them.

It's not bad, you shouldn't try to erase it, you have to educate that feeling again. What I do is turn it into action, I think about how to take better care of my family, or I make a loving gesture towards them, I prepare a cake, I make breakfast. I turn that fear into action and a loving gesture... I don't allow it to stay bouncing around in my head.

Your family must be very lucky because it is obvious that you love them very much and it is also obvious that you love yourself. You just have to redirect that love towards good actions and thoughts. 

It's not strange what you feel! You just love your family a lot. || So it's completely normal to panic every day because you're scared the people you love are dying?

Repercussions of severe and prolonged anxiety.,"NOTE BEFORE READING:it's a pretty long post,so you can go to the third paragraph in order to see what my current problems are.

Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, and I would like to know if you can help me. I’ll start by saying that I have lived with OCD since I was little. Ever since I was about 4 or 5 years old, I began to notice that I had some strange habits typical of OCD. I didn’t talk for a long time with my mom, dad, or other family members about these symptoms because I thought they wouldn’t understand me. And so the years went by, the OCD got worse, and I spent all day in my mind doing compulsions to calm the severe anxiety I was feeling. However, I still refused to tell anyone about these things and kept them only to myself.

It’s worth mentioning that I have never been clinically diagnosed—that is, I never went to a doctor to talk about it—but somewhere around age 15, I remember seeing a post somewhere on the internet about OCD, and it was the FIRST TIME I could resonate with something. I felt understood and heard. The symptoms described there were exactly like mine. That’s when I understood (quite late, I know) that this disorder I had was actually OCD. Still, I never went to a doctor to talk about it and chose to fight this condition alone, and the problems didn’t stop even after I knew what I had.Besides OCD, I also had other problems at school, with my family, and others, but I won’t go into details about those problems.

Now, talking about the present: for some time now, I have started experiencing strange sensations, like feeling faint or like I’m going through a derealization process. The thing is, I started feeling these things about 4 weeks ago, but at the beginning (like in the first week) I only felt them when I wanted to sleep—that is, when I was trying to fall asleep, I felt a sensation like I was losing contact with reality (I know it sounds strange, but that’s how I can explain it), and when I felt these things, I would start moving quickly (jerking, moving my hands and feet fast) to make the sensation go away. And it worked—the sensation disappeared momentarily. But then, obviously, when I tried to fall asleep again, I would feel these sensations again, and the process would repeat until I finally fall asleep.

The problem is that now I feel these sensations of dizziness/faintness/loss of contact with reality during the day too. But not all the time. For example, when I’m alone at home and it’s quieter (not ""dead silence,"" but somewhat quiet), I don’t feel like that. But if I go outside or start talking to someone, I start feeling that way again.

This happened yesterday as well, and I had to go to the hospital. Initially, I was in the city center, but at some point, I felt unwell and like I was going to collapse; my heart started beating faster, so I went home where I felt even worse, which is why I called an ambulance. Well, I got an IV drip, some tests, and then the doctor prescribed me some vitamins to take and I went home. But even today, right now, I feel these sensations again, and that’s why I’m afraid to go outside. I was supposed to go somewhere with my mom now, but I canceled the outing because I started to feel weird (not as bad as yesterday, but still weird), and I’m afraid that if I go outside, I’m going to faint. The thing that scares me is that my brain is sensitive to pretty much anything. Like even if I hear a car outside or a bird i start to feel dizzy again. I really don’t know what it could be. Is my central nervous system exhausted after so many years of struggle, or what’s going on? Can I still get better?","Yeah. You described the derealization/depersonalization symptoms + probably panic attack (heart pounding, feeling unwell and like you are going to collapse). 

DP/DR are basically brain mechanisms to disconnect from reality to protect the brain. I had this 5-6 years ago. It took few months to clear on it's own, but I had to work on my stress levels, etc... || You should immediately go to a doctor. || Did you to to a doctor? Did you try medication or something like this or you just made some adjustments (lower your stress levels etc.) and sort of let it pass? || Yeah, I plan on going to a neurologist as soon as possible. || I do go to regular checkups and at the time it was happening I had one. I complained about my anxiety and panic attacks so they ruled out physical causes (blood, thyroid, heart, liver checks) and referred me to psychologist. I did went for couple of therapy sessions, but what we've discussed there is that I was on a good path of understanding my anxiety, my triggers and my coping mechanism/relief + I started to properly exercise shortly after that to not be couch potato in my 30s and it paid off immensely. 

It was shitty feeling, i remember looking at my hand and feeling like it's not mine :D. That scared me off a lot, but eventually once I worked a lot on my stress(exercise, diet, sleep, etc..) it faded away on it's own.",1753699349.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbcsww/repercussions_of_severe_and_prolonged_anxiety/,Anxiety
My manager implied I was a failure in life.,"Came into the breakroom and implied that I was failure in the life. I ignored, but he went deeper into mocking me. He left after a few minutes, when I paid him no attention. Trying to be stoic. Not even looking at his direction. I was crying coming back from work. Even tried to enjoy a late night movie with my friends, but all I could think was what he said.    
Context: He usually works at a different time as me, but recently switched this week. I also used to vent a lot to my coworkers, but I’ve stopped recently. Maybe he heard the chatter from the other manager.","Anyone who says or does things like that is a miserable, awful person and you shouldn’t pay no mind to what they have to say. || That’s messed up af.

Already dreading tomorrow,"It's 12:20 AM, and I'm already dreading my usual morning anxiety, to the point where I don't even want to fall asleep. It's times like this that I hate living all alone, since that makes my anxiety so much worse. But I have to live alone if I want to keep my Section 8 housing voucher. And it's my Section 8 housing voucher that allows me to live on my own, away from my parents. And before I lived on my own, my parents and I were arguing all the time. And I certainly don't want that again. Or do I? The thought of living with my parents again is tempting. It certainly would help my anxiety.

I just wish I could be a kid again. When I was a kid, my parents actually wanted to spend time with me. Living with them was fun back then. Now, my parents need tons of alone time and they're starting to talk about traveling now that they're ""empty nesters."" Will they be traveling with me? Of course not. They don't care about my emotional well-being. They used to care, but not anymore.

But yeah. Dreading tomorrow's usual anxiety. Insomnia isn't fun. Feeling deeply depressed. Wanting to die, since that would be preferable to feeling miserably anxious, like I do in the mornings.","Hi there. I’m really sorry about all you’re going through.

Waking up with death anxiety,"Im the kind of person who believes there's nothing after death, that it's like sleeping but not waking up. (Because our brain loses consciousness forever)

So, everytime I sleep, when I wake up, I'm very much stunned like ""I'm still alive? Wtf"" don't know if anyone else relates. It's like, oh my brain is still conscious, shit why am I not cremated or buried yet? It's a very stupid thing to feel, the way to put it is how I wake up after thinking I'm dead. That's terrifying.

I think the issue is how it’s just consuming you when you are still alive, and you’ll continue to feel this until the day u die. I think i’m sad because the world is constantly changing, and the old generation is dying off, and it feels like we are destroying our earth more and more.

idek what to title this,"i guess it just makes me feel better typing it out instead of keeping it inside. i’ve struggled with undiagnosed ocd and anxiety since i was a preteen. how do i know if i ever been diagnosed? all the signs are there. i check things constantly. the stove, dryer, if all my candles aren’t lit. some days it’s not so bad and some days it can be debilitating. i worry about things i cannot control all day long. example when i was younger, if i didn’t do something “right” or on an even number, someone i love was gonna get hurt or something terrible was gonna happen.

now lately, i been drinking again. (28f) just after work and my days off. but honestly even when im not drinking the night before, i wake up panicked, body doesn’t feel right. i check myself immediately like “does my head hurt? will i be able to go to work today?” im an adult so i always have to push thru. thanks if you got this far but im just asking like how do i get diagnosed and get the help i need? and it sounds crazy im asking reddit but my husband has perfect mental health it seems or he’s good at hiding pain. my mother, she’s been a wreck losing both her sons at different stages in her life. we lost my dad recently too so i have no one to give me the slightest insight on the first step to save my mental health?🥲 -some anxious woman ","You have been carrying so much. It is okay to need help. You are not weak you are human. || I feel you. And no, you don't always have to push through. And it's not weakness but strength to ask for help. 

Asking for help from professional is the best thing you can do. That's maybe the one thing you should push through to get help :).   
  
Next best thing is to carefully analyze how you are taking care of yourself and see if there is any room for improvement. For us anxious people - sleep, diet and exercise are absolutely the things we need to take care of. I know you probably heard this millions time before but I must say - moving in any form or shape is literally the thing that makes our brains little more resilient to stress. Walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling, you name it. It has been shown again and again that you can get great relief by exercising.

What won't help you is alcohol. I know this one well and I do still occasionally have a drink, but it's not worth it most of the time. Mornings are just crazy even with few beers these days. I also love the silence of my brain when I get couple of beers/glasses of wine, but it's not a path forward. It will eventually make things much worse as we age. || 🫂 || thank you for being kind enough to answer!! you’re totally right about feeling worse later and it’s never worth the trouble but yes those hour of feeling normal ahh that’s what keeps me going back. do you think a primary care dr visit is the first step? 😭🙏🏼 || I don't know how it works where you live. In my country (Czechia) it's like that. Primary care dr that refers you to someone who can do psychology stuff. Then if it's good psychologist/psychiatrist, they will try to go over your life, triggers, lifestyle, diet, sleep patterns, etc... to try to help before prescribing any meds. If it's not a good doc, he might just prescribe meds and shrug it off (very bad). || thank you for all your info!! i had no idea the first step now i just gotta find some dr to listen to me 🥹 || Good luck! Getting help is the best thing you can do. 

But don't forget to work on yourself as well. Sometimes we overlook the most obvious solution and that's taking care of our physical health as well. It will do you wonders I'm sure!",1753697108.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbc6te/idek_what_to_title_this/,Anxiety
My Panic attack made me lock in like crazy,"One time I had a crappy panic attack a day after my first exam while I was preparing for the next one. I somewhere knew I had messed up my previous paper but I brushed it off thinking it would affect my preparation for the next one. I had told my family members that the exam went well and that it was just quite lengthy. I knew that I was not only convincing them but also myself. So as I was studying for my next paper (alone since I was in a different city living with a flatmate) I suddenly started wondering if my hard work was worth it. What if I do all this tedious study and my result turns out to be negative (if I had failed one subject I'd have to reappear all four after 3-4 Months). And this thought alone instituted a massive train of negative thoughts eventually developing into a full blown panic attack. I was pacing back and forth, breathing shallow, getting scared and startled by every little sound and movement around me. Disorientation, slurred and stuttery speech and every other horrible thing that happens during a panic attack (even had a second long thought of offing myself because of how unbearable the feeling had become) But after some time when I started getting calmed down, I thought I should quickly distract myself by studying. And that's when something crazy happened. Something that had never happened to me before. I grabbed my book, resumed the lecture on yt that I was watching before the PA and....locked in like a God. Every word the teacher was saying, every word that I was reading from my book was getting ASSIMILATED into my brain. Even when I was literally endevouring to distract my mind, or to think about something useless which I'd do so easily if it were another regular day, just to test myself, I could not. The focus I had was out of my control. It was as if my mind was suddenly programmed by some entity to behave like that. I was stunned by my own concentration power! How did I become like that?

What did laughing gas do to me?,"I don't want to go too far into detail but I had laughing gas for a spinal tap about a year ago and it was one of the most awful experiences I've ever dealt with. It felt like I was dying and trapped in my own head, I hallucinated that the walls were talking and overall I just genuinely hated it.

Now onto my question. 
Ever since that happened I can't even talk about laughing gas without crying uncontrollably and I have panic attacks whenever doctors suggest it. 

Most recently my dentist was telling me that I may need it for some work I need done and I just broke down and cried/hyperventilated for the entire visit (I didn't even get the gas) and then proceeded to cry in the parking lot for another 10-15 minutes. Now I cry before every damn appointment and usually cry when I'm there too. Even if they don't bring it up I guess I just started associating the dentist with laughing gas

 The weird part is I'm fine when I go back to where I got my spinal tap, it only happens when I or someone else starts talking about it or when I go to the dentist.

So I guess my question is, what happened? I used to be fine with all this ","Likely a form of PTSD from the panic attack and it acts as a trigger, there are many other sedation options and you can just tell them not to use it because it triggers panic attacks in you and they will understand || I didn't even consider PTSD being a part of it

 I definitely will never get gas again, I'm getting my wisdom teeth out soon and I'm just gonna have them put me to sleep for it. 

Is there any way to make myself less reactive to the subject? Like not having panic attacks every time it gets brought up? It's kind of awkward to have to calm myself down every time I go to the doctor or talk about something that other people seem to enjoy || You can look into something called EMDR therapy or maybe hypnotherapy.

A weekly planning approach that helps me manage anxiety without relying on motivation or punishing inconsistency,"Most productivity or planning systems never really worked well for me, especially when anxiety gets in the way.  
They often assume I have stable motivation, consistent energy, and clear priorities every week — but that’s rarely the case.

Instead, task lists quickly turned into guilt lists:  
– Filled with things I thought I “should” do  
– Disconnected from what I actually felt capable of or wanted  
– Making me feel more anxious or resistant instead of helping me move forward

After a while, I stopped forcing external structures and started building a way to plan based more on how I actually feel inside.

Now, my weekly rhythm looks more like this:  
– I check in with my feelings at the start of the week  
– I pay attention to how my inner state changes, not just what tasks I have  
– I focus on what matters right now, not on some “ideal” version of myself  
– I gently reflect midweek and at the end, without harsh self-judgment

It’s not a perfect or magic solution, but it helps me move through weeks with less pressure and without abandoning myself when anxiety hits.

 \- Never ever wear smart watches, it would just trigger you. || Merci pour le conseil vous ca ne vous stress pas de voir votre coeur rapidement par moment meme après un repas ? || Not really. It's natural body process -> Digestion takes energy. Usually lowers blood pressure, increases heart rate and your body gets to work to digest. 

Also depends on what you eat and how your body processes that. If you eat something heavy that takes time to digest, you can see elevated heart rate for hours. If you eat something light, it will be much easier for body to process. But it's natural for heartrate to increase. For example I just had lunch now and my HR sits in \~70bpm now and will probably reach 75 in half and hour before settling back to my usually 55 in idle.",1753694459.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbbhfh/heart_palpitations_anxiety/,Anxiety
Anxiety and friendships,"I have a lot of difficulty making friends, I've always been very shy and I've never been able to take the initiative to start a conversation with someone I want to talk to, I always stop and don't say anything, today as an adult I feel like I've missed out on a lot of things and moments because of my shyness and I think that's one of the causes of having anxiety nowadays.
I live stuck at home because it's the only place I feel good, I always think I use up a lot of energy when I leave the house, so when I'm well I don't want to go out, but when I'm in crisis one of the first things that makes me really want to cry is not having a place to go or someone to talk to, I know that's my fault, of course I don't have friends because I don't look for them myself or make an effort to keep them (also because of the anxiety of talking and thinking that the person doesn't want to talk to me, I end up moving away from those I like a lot, and I regret it)
I have people from work, but we are different ages, different topics, and I never feel like they are my real friends (I used to trust someone there and they tried to make me look like an idiot) but even so I want to start feeling like going out with them, because I can't even do that, and then I regret it too.
I have trouble even finding someone to talk to online, even with a lot of effort finding them, I still think I'm too boring and have no subject, I try hard and they don't respond, all I can do is feel sad again.
I want to change this, I want to leave the house, whether I'm comfortable or not, I don't want to be like that anymore.",,1753694268.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mbbfl6/anxiety_and_friendships/,Anxiety
Urgent Advise Needed,"Some background, I am 19 year old male born and raised in the UK. 

I've had horrible bouts of anxiety since I was 7 years old, the first that I can properly remember was from when I was in year 2 in primary school and my nice teacher who I was used to had to leave school for a while and she was replaced by this older, scarier teacher who was strict and intimidating. At first I was so scared of her that I started vomiting but after a few days I just starting telling my mum that I was sick because I was too afraid to go back to school, after a week she made me go back anyway and an hour after being at school I'd tell the teachers that I felt sick and wanted to be sent home. After two weeks I went to the doctors because my mum thought I was having some kind of health problem and they even took my blood but obviously nothing came of it. My teacher came back to school but my anxiety still persisted and it all came to a head when I ran out of the class fire exit because I saw my mum walking home through the window. I remember how stressed and miserable I made my mum even now because she got to the point where she didn't know what to do with me until I started bringing one of her old hats around with me in my bag like some kind of stress ball and somehow that worked (I was 7). 

Anyway I have had many bouts of anxiety throughout primary and secondary school but none of them were ever as bad as the first that I just detailed above and that leads me to the reason I am making this post. I never went on any anxiety medication nor have I ever spoken to any kind of therapist, when I was 15 years old in 2021 I was coming to the end of secondary school and I got really ill one day, I had some kind of stomach infection that had me bed bound for a week and during that week my anxiety returned strongly for the first time in years and I could barely handle it because not only was it health anxiety but it was also anxiety about my future and what I wanted to do with my life which was an anxiety that I had never experienced before. I stated having anxiety nightmares where I would wake up shaking and some days it would make me feel so sick that I would ask to leave school and leaving school made me feel worse because I'd tell myself that I was just using my anxiety as an excuse. Fortunately it settled down for a while until 2023 when the same kind of anxiety returned accept this time it persisted for so long that I started to question the quality of my life.

I'd be sitting in an ICT class meant for 30 students while only 4 others because sixth form is like that when out of the blue I'd just start feeling extremely hot and panicked to the point where I'd have to go and sit outside on the street for five minutes, that would happen to me at least once a week until one day when I was happening it was like something in my head broke and I realised that if I died I'd never worry again, never feel sick again, never feel like my life had no purpose and so on, that was the first time I ever truly thought about dying and up until that point I was afraid to die. I carried on despite that with a new found sense of freedom because I just didn't care anymore because whenever my anxiety came up I'd just tell myself that one day I'll be dead and whatever is worrying me won't matter at all. After spending months like that I got to a point where I'd just be walking home and suddenly I'd start tearing up out of nowhere. Eventually though in December 2023 I lost it and the school safe guarding lead who deals with kids behavioural problems didn't know how to help me because I was weeks away from being 18 so my parents to me to see a doctor and he said to speak to these two women at another health place who didn't help at all and they got me to start taking Cognitive Behavioural Therapy calls once a week and those didn't help me in the slightest so I went to a doctor again literally beside myself and he said he wouldn't give me anxiety medication because I wasn't 18 yet and they often made people worse anyway.

It is now mid 2025 and I've been working at a factory 5 nights a week for minimum wage and up until now I was just dealing with it and getting by but my anxiety has returned and I find myself thinking about my future again, I don't know what career I want to do and I know that my parents won't let me live here forever working 30 hours a week. Somewhere in the last ten years I've devolved another kind of anxiety that makes me terrified to try new things for some reason, last night I bought a can of alcohol I thought would be nice and it took me two hours of looking at it to actually try it because I kept thinking 'what if I don't like it'. When I got this stupid job I was very anxious to the point where I was pacing for an hour downstairs the night before my first shift,  hit my shin on the coffee table that many times that there was a bruise for two weeks. For the last five months I got into that state where the anxiety stopped bothering me because I kept telling myself that I'll be dead eventually and that it doesn't matter but a couple months ago my grandad died and I kept on working and my job is very boring (lots of time for reflection) and now I'm back in a state where the idea of being dead one day isn't a comfort anymore because it doesn't change the fact that I am alive right now. I just don't want my anxiety to rule my life anymore, sick of this cycle where I'm either worried or maddeningly depressed. Still haven't tried medication and I did speak to a therapist one time for a couple hours but since then I just haven't told anybody but my diary and the internet how I feel. To anybody who escaped this cycle, how tf did you do it?  
If you read this far, thanks I appreciate you, this isn't a short read.","I'm really sorry you're having a bad time of it. Im afraid that I can't really help but maybe try asking your Dr for beta blockers as they help with the physical effects of anxiety. 

I hope you feel better soon. || I have severe GAD and your thinking reminds me of GAD. Not a therapist at all. I only do coping mechanisms to make it feel less. But it's always there. It's like a monster that is always hungry but the more I feed it the worse it gets. But if you cut off the supply it gets less hungry (kinda like no face in Spirited Away, actually. Feed it too much it'll try to harm you, but cut it off and it'll be kind and helpful)


Imagining my anxiety as a character or animal who is just trying to help is useful. Then I can talk to it and say I don't need you. And I try to be aware not to feed it (doesn't work all the time, messed up this week and thought I had stage 4 cancer. Learned today that my health problems weren't even problems just basic bodily function nobody told me about and I am also unlikely to get most cancers based on family history and my lifestyle)


I'd look for what your trigger is. It's easier with a therapist. Then figure out what solutions are there in your control.

how to tell when it’s time for a mental/psych hospital..?,"i really don’t want to be put in a mental hospital, but, the intrusive and ocd thoughts about death and dying are getting to the point where i feel like shit… if i’m not worried about myself dying, it’s my mom, if it’s not about someone dying, it’s about what happens after death, etc, etc…

i spend endless nights researching, looking stuff up, and making myself worse and worse… i know i do that, and it fucking sucks… the only person that comforts me even a little bit is my mom, but, i also don’t want to overwhelm her too much…

i’m scared to take medicine, i’m scared of the possible side effects, my mom says i ‘need the medicine to make my brain work normal’, but, that’s just not fair… it’s not fair that some people don’t need medicine to ‘feel normal’… it doesn’t make sense to me and it’s not fair that some people can not think about death or dying at all, while others literally want to die, and then there’s people like me that would do anything to avoid death of ourselves or our loved ones…

i’m not eating right (not even a full meal a day, some days i don’t eat anything at all… like yesterday, all i had all day was a few bites of chicken noodle soup…) i don’t drink as much as normal (i try to continue to drink, but, i just can’t do it as often as usual…) i don’t sleep properly, my sleep schedule is completely awful, and when i do sleep, i wake up atleast once… i also have the shakes really bad (especially when i’m anxious) and then i get nausea and stomach pains sometimes as well…

i’m just not doing great. i have a family history of people having nervous breakdowns, and i don’t want it to get to that point… i also don’t have a therapist right now, just chat gpt, which sometimes does help in the moment, but, no amount of reassurance actually helps me…

if anyone has any advice that would be helpful, or if anyone has been to a mental hospital and thinks i should/shouldn’t go… thanks in advance! 🩷","Heaven isn’t so bad tho ? Besides what exactly are you researching? Are you suffering from hypochondria ? || Side effects of anxiety medicine isn't that bad. Not any worse than BC. 


I think your mom is right, and a therapist would help a lot. Mental hospital can be temporary. I've never been to one but my family members have and it seems only helpful for a little while. Finding stability in everyday life is probably better and a good therapist can help a lot with that. 


I have not been able to eat or sleep either recently because of some severe anxiety, but I talked to my therapist, she found my trigger (it was a word I didn't understand on my test results), I went to a doctor to explain the word to me. Anxiety gone, can eat food again, now I finally feel relaxed.


I have pretty severe GAD and although sometimes it's unbearable, finding triggers and solving the problems I'm having is so helpful but it's hard to find by myself. (I didn't realize my trigger was the word on my test result until my therapist told me, 5 days of sleepless nights and barely eating and shaking so bad I couldn't hold a pencil, and skin so pale my lips turned blue. Severe anxiety. All because of one word I misunderstood) || heaven isn’t bad at all, that’s what i would ‘prefer’ to happen after death, but, nobody knows for sure, and that’s what scares me… i do have hypochondria, and i’m scared of dying or my loved ones dying and me ending up alone… || i understand… i’m happy you’re feeling a bit better right now, i just don’t know what to do… i’m so stressed, i want the feeling to go away NOW, i don’t want to wait… which i know is selfish, and isn’t how it works, but, it sucks, and it hurts… || The concept of Heaven is literally in every culture. It’s an Eventuality, if Heaven isn’t real it eventually will be. 

Your researching is pretty pointless at any moment you can just slip and fall. You’re gonna spend so much time worrying that you won’t get to fully enjoy your time. 

You just go about your day be brave but the Universe gives and takes what it wants. 

In life you’ll lose things and gain things it’s a balance 

Maybe God made the cost of existence death. 

Besides there are much scarier things than death, seems more like an obsession on your part || https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/looking-after-yourself/tolerating-distress


It's not selfish it's just how you're feeling because anxiety sucks. I totally get it. I said the same thing today to my therapist before I fixed my issue (tbh I still feel uncomfortable hence why I'm even on this sub just to solidify to myself that I'm okay)


A weird thing that sometimes works for me is drawing what my anxiety looks like. 


Or, this is more research based, write down how you feel. Everything. On paper. Rip it up and throw it away. 


And lastly breathe through your stomach. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. When you breathe out try to use your abdominal muscles.


That's how you can get it to go away now.

Pubmed studies on benzos and dimentia why are doctors spreading rumors?,"Methods: This study adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The research strategy incorporated terms such as ""benzodiazepines"" OR ""benzodiazepine"" AND ""cognitive dysfunction"" OR ""dementia"" AND ""adult"" OR ""elderly"" OR ""aged."" We included prospective and retrospective observational studies, as well as case-control studies. Data were meticulously extracted regarding chronic BZ use and dementia risk. Each study's risk of bias was assessed to ensure result validity. Statistical analysis was performed using hazard ratios (HR) as the primary meta-analysis summary measure to provide a precise evaluation of associated risk.

Results: Analysis of five studies showed that chronic BZ use was associated with a nonsignificant risk of dementia-without specification of cause-with an HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.96-1.43). Regarding Alzheimer's disease, three studies found no significant association with an HR of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.87-1.15).

Conclusions: Our findings did not reach statistical significance, suggesting no strong link between chronic BZ use and dementia. Further research is needed to clarify this potential association.

Non stop anxiety after a panic attack out of nowhere 7 weeks ago (TW: Health anxiety and existentialism),"About 7 weeks ago, I had a very bad panic attack brought on by health anxiety, which i have noticed started to develop earlier this year. I had consecutive panic attacks for 4 days after that because my chest was so tight and painful. I am definitely better than i was but I was in a derealisation state for about 2 weeks after that which I think has brought on an existential crisis. All of a sudden I’m panicking about being alive and having a brain and I can’t get over how weird and terrifying that is. It’s easier today so i can talk about it, but i feel like my body doesn’t belong to me, and i feel like i have gained access to knowledge that’s forbidden or something. I feel trapped but like i know panicking about it isn’t going to get me very far. I just feel like a completely different person to who i was 2 months ago. I guess I’m asking for advice and if anyone has been through this how did you/are you working through this? I am in therapy already and i am not on medication (i used to be) i wanted to try and get through this without meds, so I’ve been trying a couple of herbal things but so far nothing has worked that well.

How to pull yourself out of thoughts?,"I have pretty bad anxiety, and I’ve probably had a few minor panic attacks in the past but I’m not entirely sure. When you’re so deep into the anxious thoughts, how do you pull yourself out of it? I haven’t been able to sleep much these past few days because of it. I just keep getting lost in thoughts of what if and I end up spending days or hours hyper fixating on what’s giving me anxiety and I can’t control it. Especially since I’m on summer break and don’t have anything to do and don’t really have friends, it’s got a bit worse. The day just passes by and all I do is sit there and think.","You must not try to seek reassurance or do anything that would somehow make you feel better about it. As that works like addiction, making it keep coming back. || I feel you on that. Getting stuck in your own head is the worst, right? Okay, so here’s what I usually do when my brain won’t shut up. First, breathe. I know, sounds basic, but seriously… just take one slow, deep breath. Then another. Kinda brings you back to your body. Sometimes I’ll just say out loud, “Hey, I’m overthinking.” Like, literally call it out. Weirdly helps. || I’m sorry I don’t understand what u mean by that? Unless I’m interpreting it wrong || Weirdly enough, it does help pull me back to reality a bit! || No problem. I now see why that wouldn't make sense. Can you first give an example of something you have been fixating on? I think I can better explain it that way. || I’ve been fixating on my health a lot recently, lately it’s mostly just been health anxiety and just what if something’s wrong with me? It’s mostly the fear that something may be wrong and I might miss it. It’s like my brain is just waiting for something to be wrong so it can be right about it. 😅 

As someone who has weird health issues at time, the big C (cancer) is always just a looming threat whenever you google your issues and my brain is trying to convince me I have this and that. || Alright, that's actually what my main fear was, too. 

So, the way it works is, the core of any anxiety is having low tolerance of uncertainty. Besides it causing anxiety itself, it also triggers the need to do something about the fear. With health anxiety it's typically some kind of reassurance seeking like obsessively monitoring yourself, googling, maybe asking people or going to doctors a lot. And each time you do anything like that, you further reinforce your low tolerance of uncertainty, therefore reinforcing the whole problem. That makes the problem stay and depending on the frequency of these actions maybe even making it get worse and worse. This works like addiction. The anxiety makes you do these actions and then these actions make anxiety stay. 

And the way to get better is force yourself not to engage in it. So when for example you start worrying you might have cancer, you must just sit with that. Not doing anything that would somehow try to disprove you have cancer or anything to that effect. If you manage to do that long enough, your tolerance of uncertainty goes up a little, resulting in less anxiety and less of these thoughts in general. 

Do you understand the logic of this? I'm not sure I explained it coherently. || I see, I’m glad that we have a similar type of anxiety. 

My next question is kind of subjective and a bit hard to answer since supposedly “you know your body best”. But I’m wondering is there any way to condition your brain or body to know when something’s alarming and what’s just a false alarm? 

Honestly, dealing with anxiety it kind of feels like you don’t know your own body at all and when something’s a problem because everything feels like a problem. || In my opinion, if you're not sure if there is something wrong, that means there isn't. Because if there was something clearly wrong, your anxiety would be even much worse than this. || Thank u for the responses, it’s been pretty reassuring, I appreciate it! I definitely feel a little better, the thought still lingers, but knowing the psychology behind it makes it more bearable. Hopefully, it truly is a false alarm since these past few weeks have been my worst cases of anxiety 😵‍💫.

Will try to stay away from social media and google for a while and hope that the thoughts lessen over time! Would it be ok if I had more questions to dm you? It’s nice knowing I’m not out there alone and someone’s got a method for this😅 || No problem. I should add that avoiding triggers also make it worse, so make sure you're not going out of your way to not encounter anything anxiety inducing. The right way is to simply go about everything as if anxiety wasn't a factor. So for example allow yourself to use Google, but not for this.

Also lack of sleep makes it worse. Potentionally much worse if it's on regular basis. And caffeine, too.

My anxiety is affecting my sleep. Tips please?,"I've recently had immense trouble sleeping and it's affecting my life more and more, and I've found the main cause of this is my anxiety. I'm rather uneducated when it comes to dealing with my anxiety so any advice would be appreciated thank you ","Dunno exactly what you mean by immense trouble. If you mean like insomnia, no sleep whatsoever, I'd go to a doctor and get some medicine.


I tried to find ways to sleep while intensely anxious (the waiting kind where my trigger was out of my control) like puzzles, asmr, cat videos, sibling rivalry podcast. They were for temporary insomnia but like a week of insomnia I don't think can be solved by yourself


You need sleep to think clearly. Sleep makes anxiety less severe and easier to problem solve. If you can't sleep you're not gonna be able to sleep without sedating yourself. 


But only take sleeping pills if it's desperate (like literal no sleep for days). It's not useful for if you're just a bit anxious. 


Also just 2 hours of sleep is better than zero sleep.


For me how I can tell:
Screaming crying: take the sleeping pill
Sleepy but keep waking up: sibling rivalry, wake up and drink some milk
Just feeling anxious and tossing and turning: puzzles
Want to call hotline level anxiety: drink water and puzzles


I know it's weird that I calling a hotline level of anxiety I wouldn't use sleeping pill for, but that's because for some reason when I feel suicidal all I need is a distraction and then.I fall asleep. Screaming crying I am scared, my fight or flight is going off, sleeping feels like death, nothing could convince me to sleep. Only medicine works.


I used to use clozanepam for this but it doesn't work for screaming crying anxiety. Sleeping pills are better. I stopped using clozanepam after I realized this. Kinda dunno the point of it if it doesn't help me with severe anxiety.


Anyway, this is just what works for me. Also sometimes I just get random insomnia I don't do anything for and the next day I can sleep.


Also a hot shower or bath, dunno how it works, makes me knock out two hours later. Not every time and if I am expecting to sleep it doesn't work. But if I take a bath then go do some puzzles or other calming stuff I end up sleeping without noticing it.",1753688529.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb9zf4/my_anxiety_is_affecting_my_sleep_tips_please/,Anxiety

To make things worse I think my social anxiety has been getting worse I needed to enter somewhere and the security guard was asking for my I'd and was asking some general questions but I was shuttering, avoiding eye contact and my hands were shaking even though I did nothing wrong and he even gestured to the other gaurd that ""her hands are shaking"" 

Why am I so scared? Why do I breathe so heavily am i unconsciously isolating myself? 

What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? My dad compares me to my sister who's so confident and extroverted but it's not my fault that I'm introverted it's just my nature since childhood 

I do get attention online but im not happy about it and I feel numb (even though I wanted that few days ago and now that I'm getting it I don't like it anymore) 

I tried talking to my father or mother but they just dismiss it saying there's nothing wrong with me (ofcourse cuz I come from a brown family) 
When I'm with my friends I just play a character which isn't me

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is this just anxiety or could it be something else? I feel like I’m losing control of my life and I’m honestly scared. I just want to feel normal again.

Any advice, support, or even just someone who gets it would mean the world right now

Thankyou for reading","So when my anxiety hits I can't even remember how to spell. I've got GAD so this is normal to me. I understand it's terrifying at first. Had a coworker think she had a brain tumor but it was just a panic attack. Which was obvious to me but not to her. (Honestly, don't blame her. I also just thought I was going to die over a misunderstanding of my ct scan, my doctor didn't say it was serious but my anxiety convinced me it was. Went back to the doctor and had her explain to me in detail how my body works and why I am fine.)


My mom and brother both have panic attacks when driving. My brother once had to drive to the doctor but got confused during traffic and cried and called my mom to come get him. I am so anxioys about driving I've never even gotten my license (I also don't live where it's necessary so I am lucky here)


When your brain checks out, that's a normal symptom of anxiety.


I dropped my phone once and then fell off an escalator and then got stuck in a train door all in the same day because I couldn't focus.


Some people faint or have jelly legs or are unable to hold a pen. I've had times I couldn't write anything or speak. I thought I had a stroke (maybe I did though 😂)


I think you're a normal person with out of control anxiety that can be treated with therapy and better coping skills. Your parents are not helping you by invalidating your feelings.


Go seek a therapist if possible. You don't have to be mentally ill to go see one (I went because I cried too much. Doctor said I am HSP, but was fine, 5 years later GAD, and probably GAD my whole life) Anyway, I think therapy is very useful. ",1753687315.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mb9ojm/i_think_somethings_wrong_with_me/,Anxiety
Wellness Wednesday,">*“Sometimes the bravest and most important thing you can do is just show up.” - Brené Brown*

Midweek is a good time to check in.  
This thread is open to whatever’s on your mind.

What’s been going well?  
What’s been frustrating?  
What’s something you’re trying to handle?  
What’s helped you get through the week so far?

You don’t need to explain everything.  
You don’t need to have a big insight.

Just show up. Say what you want.  
We’re listening.

**How are you doing, really?**","I told my sister I wished I had her dog and how much I loved him.

She replied with: I’m mentally unwell (given that I have diagnoses and am being treated and she’s on medication).

r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

My daughter thinks I have a mental illness,"I (41M) have been arguing with my second-eldest child (13F) for the past few months. It's always about the same general theme, accusations of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and narcissism. Her accusations come from my ""hallucinations and being weird as fuck"" (I deny the hallucinations). I get that she has reasons to be upset with me (my diagnosed depression, and her mother and I separated a few months ago) and she's probably just concerned, but I think she's still being majorly disrespectful, to me and people who actually do have those problems. I'm not really sure if this is the place for this post but I'm just really stressed out. ","I just feel like there really isn't enough information to give any kind of guidance tbh. It could be that you are sick, she is sick, both are sick or there are some other underlying issues that just come out in a different way than they actually are. I don't want you to share your private stuff to Reddit but from what you tell, there isn't much to go about. Have you really deeply talked with her why she thinks that or do you outright just deny everything? I would keep asking more questions || Therapy. Both of you. Even if all it does is make the separation easier for her. This is tough for a kid her age, she fully knows what's happening, hormones go crazy, she wants to be grown but she is still learning so much. It's very confusing, so parents splitting can't help. || Divorce or separation can be highly stressful for teenagers. Please go to therapy together. || Considering that you’re currently separated from your wife, I think that you should consider getting some counseling. 
But try to remember that your child is 13 years old and doesn’t know much. However, they may be pointing out some aspects of your behavior that you may not see. They also could possibly be repeating things back that their mother said about you. 
Regardless of if you have a deeper mental illness or not, you should probably go and seek out some counseling. This is a huge transition for everybody. || I have these types of arguments. You have to be able to accept you might be wrong on some of it, and children don't always mean something bad just because they mention something. It's just an opinion like any other.

  Maybe get a real assessment, and say hey I had this looked into what you mentioned. It's hard to tell because kids have friends that could be saying stuff that is either true or false.

They are 13, and becoming independent in their views, as they grow into being a young adult. || Oh of course. My mother always invented bullshit about me. She made my childhood like a fucking thriller


I always told everyone exactly the same as your daughter but they believed her. For the last 10 years we are strangers for each other and she's on disability for undisclosed mental illness.


What are your hallucinations consisting of according to her?
Maybe you should hear her out. || Do the right thing and go see a therapist if possible, right after you started doing so ask your daughter to do the same thing, just to get her help with the divorce. In my opinion it would be beneficial for you to take the first step and also to show her that you are taking her serious.
Good luck and all the best to all of you! || I’m hesitant to fully believe you. Only because my mom is very mentally ill and she refuses to believe it. She now has no relationship with any of her children besides the youngest who lives with her part time. I think therapy is the only way to go here. || There's always a chance that you're hallucinating even having a daughter, so you should probably listen to her and get checked out... || then why not have yourself diagnosed so you can prove whatever it is that needs to be proven? || I hear your pain and I'm so sorry you're going through this. Your stress and discomfort is valid and like most have suggested, I recommend therapy for the both of you. It's not about problems or finding labels. I know I'm an internet stranger, but you have such a great opportunity here to grow with your daughter during a really rough time in anyone's life, being a teenager. This could be a fantastic bonding experience that might just bring you closer, as rough as things might be. 

Having a professional to help guide both of you might take the pressure off not only yourself but your daughter too with navigating the world. She may find a better understanding of what she wants to communicate to you. Those lessons in life are priceless and can seriously help build foundations for successful outcomes. 

Even if you don't see that being an option, please amuse the idea and consider it even in a hypothetical  scenario. 

Parents and kids don't always get things right and life is so messy. In this day and age, it's almost stacked against us that we break away from each other. Life is so short and you never know what tomorrow will bring. Please, give this a chance and mull it over || What if your daughter is right?
I only discovered two years ago that I have dissociative identity disorder. I'm 43.
Some of these disorders are very covert.

Why not get some therapy together and let her air her grievances?

The other explanation that comes to mind is if your ex is making up stuff about you and your daughter believes it. Being in therapy may help that as well, even if you don't necessarily need it. It looks good to your daughter to take care of your mental health. || Therapy. Your daughter is 13 and is still developing- while this is hard to hear from your child, it’s your job as a parent to be patient and can be helpful to even say I hear you and I’m willing to take what you’re saying into consideration and then get into therapy. Part of me thinks that if you’re fighting it so hard (with a 13 year old….) then it might be worth looking in the mirror. Maybe not for schizophrenia or narcissism (maybe buzzwords kids have access to now more than ever), but to understand how to communicate with your teenager in a way that works better and ensuring she’s provided an outlet to talk to someone who has bandwidth to hear her out. If money is an issue, for yourself, look into a sliding scale program- psychologytoday.com is like the Google for therapy and you can put in preferences and insurance info. Maybe it’s worth reaching out to her school guidance counselor to discuss that you’re worried about her. My brother did this for me and I got pulled from class one day to meet her. At first I was embarrassed but all she did was introduce herself and let me know that I could come talk to her anytime. She also helped get me into therapy. 

All this is coming from a 29f who is estranged from her father and is deeply sad about it, but it’s because he will not do anything to help himself and wound up treating me very poorly once I entered adulthood. If you find it hard to manage your anger when these things come up, that would be reason alone enough to go to therapy. You’re the adult and she is the child. Her having thoughts and opinions and challenging you is a vital part of development and you arguing with her is dismissing her experience. Even if there isn’t truth to what she is saying, there’s always room for growth in a parent-child relationship and it’s worth it for the long run especially when tensions are high. She’s arguing with you and calling you out because she wants connection and her anger shows a need isn’t being met. || You can find a study on Yale medicine and elsewhere that covid triggered autoimmune disorders which there are very many probably at least a hundred so the likelihood is there actually with something like covid so I don't know if you looked into that yet a lot of people are in denial at first as well as like dormant viruses and other long-term neurological problems || I'm just saying that because I have kids and there was a possibility of something triggering during covid related to celiac disease and gluten || You don't provide a lot of detail on what's going on but what little you do provide tells me you both should be in some kind of therapy and you need a neutral 3rd party involved to help you. 

You may have some issues you are even consciously aware of and she's trying to show you in her best way she can. Which probably isn't very good considering she's 13yo.

She could have some issues that both of you aren't consciously aware of and there's nothing truly wrong with you. 

Or you both could have issues you're not consciously aware of. 

Your ex-wife may be planting things in her head due to built-up resentment from long before the divorce.

All these are possible but only family and individual therapy will be able to truly dig it out. || Honestly, as somebody who has a father that I am 99% sure has mental health issues but refuses to get them diagnosed. I can tell you what would get me to stop hounding you. 

Go to a therapist. Go to a doctor someone and get yourself tested for said mental disorder. || Are you and your wife seperated or something ? || It sounds like she is in need of counseling as well as you to process through this life change maybe even some family counseling. 

But she’s a teen she is going to say hurtful mean things and not think twice. I’m sorry you have to experience this.

Also just because you’re going through something doesn’t give anyone the right to be a jerk.

Three, it’s one of those websites that the cops use to catch ”possible suspects”.

Actual videos are found in other places not accesible through normal search engines. Unless you were looking for something with an encrypted browser, I don't think such videos are something other than role-playing.

I’m tired of working my life away.,"I’m only 20 years old (Female living in America) but I’ve been working since I was 16. I’m so tired of the constant rat race I feel like a robot.  Clock in,eat ,prepare for work the next day, sleep and do it all over again. It’s exhausting and frankly it has me hating my life every single day. I dread waking up because I know it’s another day of unfulfilling bs working making pennies on the dollar. Maybe if there was some kind of pay off it would make it better but I’m working to survive and I can’t afford to buy a house even though we are a dual income house with no kids yet. I want to have kids but with the economy the way it is I don’t know how anyone is affording it. I’m usually a very happy person but recently (the last 6mo) I’ve been so depressed and I hate to get up everyday just to work. I have trichotillamania (where you pull out your hair) and I probably have half my head of hair left from the stress of it all. I feel exhausted and like I’m drowning. All of this just to hear “well that’s life” BUT IT SHOULDNT BE. How is everyone else not angry like I am about this. Edit; I do have hobbies too, many of them but it still doesn’t help or make my life feel balanced ","Can you look at doing further study or look for another job? You shouldn't be this miserable with work. To be fair  working is a total pain! || maybe u need less hours or a different job, if u strongly think your job is unfulfilling. not to sound like a preacher or bs, but i think everyone on earth has some kind of importance and role as to why they exist. jobs do help others regardless, but it isn’t helping u, u got to ask yourself why besides work being tiring (be more specific, because all jobs require a lot of work. ex: are u on your feet a lot and doing lots of labor? is that why it’s tiring?) pinpointing the real reasons as to why u don’t like your job helps u avoid those factors in the future.

my first initial suggestion was hobbies (which i see the edit) and exercise, plus getting outside and spending time with loved ones (family & friends). if you’re isolated and not socializing much, that will prob damage your mental health over time. || Find something you love and you'll never wor.....

Nah, fuck that. Working sucks. You are correct. The only time where it doesn't suck so much is if you are working for yourself. Then you can choose how much you want to work. 

Also, want what you have, and don't want what you don't have. Curb your desires. || Thank you for your response I appreciate  it. I honestly do think less hours would be better for me but my job has the best pay I’ll find for my area so I’m not sure how I’ll be able to find pay that is adequate for me with less hours if that makes sense. In response to the part about having roles and importance, I feel like I do have a role or purpose in this life that I have known forever and that is to be a mom.🫠 as cliche as that may sound. || i understand where you’re coming from when u find a unicorn job and it’s still draining with the hours, on top of feeling stuck with the thought that it’s unlikely that you’ll find something else that’s a higher pay and easier to manage. i’m sort of in a similar boat, but the pay, time off that i have with loved ones, and practicing gratitude for having such a good job that brings me money and me closer to my goals is what keeps me sane at the end of the night. 

if i were u, if the pay and job is truly worth it, i would stick it out at your current job and take less hours if possible. if that doesn’t work over time, then maybe u should job search while still keeping your job and see if there are better options. at the end of the day, your hard work is your hard work and your money. you’re still working towards your future and goal, even if you’re burnt out and feel it is pointless. i’m not saying to steamroll your feelings, but your efforts are not pointless at the end of the day. 

i would use your goals and life purpose as a source of strength, stay connected to yourself and loved ones, and practice gratitude, while u manage your job stress. it just honestly sounds like u need to take a break by either taking less hours or a vacation, but ofc that’s easier said than done. i would strongly consider reaching out to family and friends about your situation, because they know u better than someone like me/a stranger on the internet offering advice. || Provide Love to the type of man that will provide the life you want.",1753788009.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc8qbp/im_tired_of_working_my_life_away/,mentalhealth
A reminder that OCD doesn’t mean “clean and tidy”,"This is very embarrassing to post, but I want to remind everyone that OCD is not the, “keep everything clean and organized” stereotype that Hollywood portrays. There are many types of OCD, and only a percentage of those with OCD have the types that make someone obsessed with cleanliness. For me, my OCD takes up so much of my mental energy that I cannot keep my spaces clean. I struggle immensely with doing daily chores, and have extremely bad executive dysfunction due to OCD  and ADHD. The constant shame I feel around the state of my spaces causes me to feel embarrassed about cleaning when anyone else is home, meaning I never clean, which then cycles over and over until I end up living like this. I will be starting with removing the garbage from my room for today, and hopefully do laundry tomorrow. 

I have over a dozen cups of rotting coffee and fruit in my room. I have clothing and laundry on the floor in my room and bathroom. I haven’t vacuumed my room in 5 months. I have garbage piling up in my bathroom. 

I get anxiety about going into my spaces because of the mess, but more anxiety about cleaning it and being judged while I do. It’s not logical, but mental illness isn’t logical either. 

Edit: I got the garbage picked up!","I have ocd. And I could totally relate to you. I've had a hard time cleaning up my space and it usually would take me a month to bring my dirty clothes to the laundry place. || Lots of people have struggles like this. Be gentle on yourself.  Set small goals like one thing in a day or give yourself an hour to do something and then chill after that is up. X || Thank you so much for sharing this. What you wrote is so important and brave. OCD is so deeply misunderstood, and I really appreciate you shedding light on what it actually looks and feels like for you. The stereotype of being 'clean and organized' really harms people who are struggling in silence with the more invisible, exhausting parts ; like intrusive thoughts, compulsions, shame, and executive dysfunction.

What you’re dealing with is *so real*, and it doesn’t make you lazy or messy; it makes you someone navigating an incredibly difficult illness. The fact that you took a step and picked up the garbage is huge. Seriously. That matters. That’s not small.

You’re not alone in this, and you’re not gross or broken. You’re doing your best, and your best counts ; even when it doesn’t look like what others expect. Keep going, one step at a time. We see you. || *This.*

My experience of OCD is that whenever I start, it's like it was never enough. || Yes, I have OCD and relate to you. || As some who is in fact clean and tidy, reading this post makes me shiver in fear || Yea.

FELT this in my bones. I'm so sorry man. Please don't give up || It sucks to hear that you are going through such an awful time right now. Getting cheated on is one of the worst feelings someone can go through. And then feeling trapped in a shitty situation on top of it all? Fuck, that's hell. I've been in a pretty similar place, and I feel you.

It sounds like you do have a plan or goal in mind, and you're taking real steps toward it, even if it's not working out yet. Applying, consulting, trying to change your situation, that takes a lot of guts when you're heartbroken and running on empty. You're doing something, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.

Honestly though, grinding your way out isn't the only part of the equation. You've got to take care of your own emotional needs too. That kind of grief doesn’t just go away by moving cities or changing jobs. The pain has to be felt and processed. That part’s brutal, but necessary. And you deserve time, space, and compassion while you go through it. Be patient with yourself.

I know it stings seeing your ex live the dream you thought you’d be living together. But that's her path now, so try not to focus on it too much. Your story isn’t over, it’s just in a dark chapter. It might not feel like it now, but there’s still meaning in what you’re going through. Try to make this chapter about you and about healing and learning to love yourself again.

You’re not broken. You’re just hurting. There’s a difference. And you’re not alone.

I've been on anti-depressants for a week and here are my thoughts,"I think the purpose of anti-depressants is supposed to give you enough energy to motivate yourself to start solving your problems so the depression can go away entirely. It's not really gonna work for me because the problems that make me the most depressed are things that I'm never going to be able to fix. I *feel* slightly better but I still remember all the shit that makes my life worthless so it's not a complete cure.

I've been trying to connect with LGBTQ community because I hate myself so much and maybe if I were with people similar I would stop hating myself but it seems like a lot of LGBTQ communities are not welcoming of someone who struggles with internalized homophobia and transphobia. They just want to celebrate Pride all the time which is fine, it's not problem if that's what they want, I just feel sad that I will not be able to join them. I already feel like I excluded from general population for being queer. My family doesn't like me at all. I always wish I could be someone else but I can't. There's just nothing I can do to solve this.","Reminder that it can take up to 6 weeks to feel the full effects of antidepressants. You're a week in, you're not supposed to feel better yet. || I hear you and for what it's worth, I'm glad you're here with us. I myself took a long time to grapple with inner turmoil and often face it over again. Healing and growing isn't linear, which kinda makes the whole process more forgiving, given human nature

As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I want to say an official welcome! We're often all on our own journey in life and it's pretty messy and with every community, there's always going to be people with not so great intentions and others that will click with you almost immediately. It's all a matter of time and meeting others. I found the best places to connect with the community are volunteering and also going to events and talking to people, especially at any art stalls. If being there in person isn't a safe option, online communities are in abundance and there's no shame in taking your time and shopping around

I don't want to preach too much, especially as an internet stranger. But you're not alone, I promise you this. 

It sounds like you've got a lot of pain to carry and I'm genuinely sorry you're struggling with that. You shouldn't have to. Please, wherever you can, try to show yourself kindness as you would towards a friend going through a hard time || Remember that one week is too little for the drug, it took me at least a month to feel the minimal effect, which increased over time, so be patient before jumping to conclusions.",1753793364.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcajr3/ive_been_on_antidepressants_for_a_week_and_here/,mentalhealth
I absolutely detest having genitals,"It's genuinely started to cause me significant distress, I hate having stupid useless appendages I don't want or need, that make it impossible for me to wear any trousers my size and have a million different ways of getting in a painful position that I then can't do anything against because I'm in public. 

I know women have it worse in every regard, I'm not making a comparison here. It just sucks. I'm genuinely avoiding going outside as much as possible because I know that my genitals show through my bloody clothes and there's jackshit I can do about it except wear something massively oversized that looks horrendous and is extremely uncomfortable to wear. 

That's all","As a man who has to fold his dong before heading out, I understand. Hope you find peace and a solution. || Unless you have a monster dong or a boner 24/7, no one will notice. || Nobodies looking at your gents. And if they are they either fancy you or are judging you. Thats on them. || Nobody can see your genitals in a pair of jeans.

I have 100% never once in my life noticed a man’s penis through his clothes out in public. Not once.

Just don’t wear speedos walking down the street. || Have you experienced any sexual abuse or struggling with your sexuality or gender identity? Because generally that’s where feelings like this come from. || Watch the movie Circle of Iron see if you relate. || put on a pair of shorts underneath your trousers, the extra layer thickens and disguises the bulge of your penis. || Become a smoothie || So a few points:
1. Women do NOT have it worse in all regards. WTF??
2. Have you tried wearing different kinds of underwear? I notice that baggy underwear leads to more uncomfortable positions as very tight ones. 
3. Use the dong! Why call it useless? Stand on a bridge and pee down from it! Go fuck someone! Jerk off! No man who is fully sane would call his dick useless..?
4. What bulge..? And who cares? Imagine what the worst thing is that someone could do? Come up to you and say ''hihi you have genitals' and you would be like 'HIHIHI you too' || Please please get professionals help for these thoughts and the distress it causes you. These thoughts can lead to terrible outcomes, such as cutting off the body part that is target of the thoughts. That never solves the problem, and then people do on to do more harm to themselves. Please. There is help. Treatment works. || This happens because everything has been sexualised. From body to food everything is sexualised. You are not comfortable with your genitals, women aren't comfortable too because men must be watching them with greedy eyes. 

Let's skip this body trap for a moment. Can you think and describe yourself beyond your physical body? What are your interests, hobbies explore them go deep into them. || Is this gender dysphoria? Maybe ur non binary. || Baggy trousers. It's as simple as a madness song. || Possibly they won't notice but it being way too visible is a fact, after all I noticed it first in the mirror. The crotch area is usually way too close to the waistband. 

Not just that, it's so bad that it pulls down the front of said waistband a bit, even though It's have neither of those issues. I don't really get erections at all. And the type of clothes that wouldn't have this issue are prohibitively expensive for me. || Ha, I'd be distraught over both || Oh, that's what I've been doing wrong :/ || 'tis more a testicle issue actually. They do unfortunately take up space. || No sexual abuse, maybe one instance of very minor sexual assault but that's not too relevant, I wouldn't even define it as sexual in nature. I couldn't say I have any ""feelings"" congruent with my gender or anything like that (I don't understand the concept), my stance on that topic is just...apathy. || Ha ha. || 1. Okay probably not all regards but I wanted to be on the safe side and preempt anyone bringing it up or something, I don't know 

2. That's actually what I've been thinking about, getting some tighter underwear. Only really realistic step I can think of. 

3. I have no interest in any of that. 

4. Testicles tend to take up a good bit of space. And I know it's not a crime, that doesn't change that it makes me uncomfortable.

The new online safety act in the UK is really making me stressed and anxious,"The UK has just passed an online safety, which means anything that the UK gov deems unsafe for children to see you have to give an id (like a passport or driving licence) or a selfie.
Well Reddit asked me to verify my age and I, stupidly, took a pic of my passport and ever since reading about this law and everything, I've been extremely stressed and anxious, it's really messing with my head. I'm already prone to anxiety and this is just spiking it.","A lot of people (including myself) have been worried, so you're not alone. I'm not sure how much you can do now that you've given up your information. Maybe there's a way you can contact the processing company to have it removed? If not, just make sure that you don't submit it on another site. For everything else, please just install a VPN to bypass it or edit sites in the inspect element tab to remove the pop-up (I don't think the second one will work for all but it does for some). The government announced today that they aren't considering a VPN ban so they should work for the foreseeable future without as big of a privacy issue (if you choose a secure provider).

Again, you're valid for feeling concerned. A lot of sites have been blocked despite not containing adult content in the porn sense (which is what they were marketing the bill towards). If you haven't done so already, I'd suggest signing the petition against the OSA. It's already got almost 400k signatures and the more it gets, the more likely they'll take it seriously. It's the only way that we can really make a stand for the moment and (hopefully) make a difference. || Yeah, I have contacted the processing company and I'm waiting to see what'll happen.
It's all so stupid what's going on and isn't helping anyone, it's only causing people concern and anxiety that their info might just be floating around the internet 😞 || Keep me updated on how it turns out. I've been interested in seeing if they'd actually remove your data if you asked them to. 

It's literally the most pointless bill to ever be introduced. It can easily be bypassed, causes unnecessary stress, and infringes upon internet freedoms. I can't imagine this ever ends up being a good thing || Will do.

Is it weird to think sex is gross but only when I imagine myself doing it?,"
Like, I don’t have a problem with other people having sex. I don’t judge it, I’m not against it morally, and I even understand why it matters to people.

But when I imagine myself in that situation, it feels disgusting. Not just awkward, straight-up repulsive. I don’t want to be touched, seen, or involved. The idea of me having sex makes me recoil. It’s not trauma-related as far as I know. It’s just there.

Anyone else feel this? Is this a self-image thing? Asexuality? Some kind of detachment or overthinking? I’m not sure what to make of it.","I totally get this… it’s not a constant but… I’d rather watch the movie in my head where the avatar of me does it… so, it’s me but not me…? Not sure if that makes sense || I am the exact same way and I am asexual. To be more specific- sex positive and sex repulsed
Sex positive/negative/neutral- attitude towards sex in general removing yourself from the equation
Sex repulsive/favorable/indifferent- how you feel about sex in relation to yourself. 

Obvi this is a simplistic view which gets more nuanced, but it may be worth considering and evaluating your feelings. What you are describing is a very common asexual experience. But you may not be asexual, and that is okay too. So in short, no. It isnt weird || i don’t think it’s weird, i’m the exact same way. i think we’re just asexual 🫡 || I totally get you. I could play fake sex scenerios in my head all day but when it comes to real life im not interested at all. Im not sure but we might be just asexual. || Yes I am mostly like this it's pretty gross but 20% of the time its cool.  Are you on any med it might be from my SSRI || Conscientiousness is a human thing, and all too many people lack it. || I have a situation similar but a little different. I actually fantasize about me having sex and porn has played a big role in that. But from the time I can remember, when I did physically have sex; it felt gross. I wasn't excited about it, I never ejaculate and I just do it so the other person enjoys their time and I literally can't wait til it's over! It's strange because when I'm horny & alone, I'd reminisce about those times I engaged with people and I enjoy it in my mind but whenever it comes to real life in the moment.. I just can't do it. 
I had one relationship and with that person that's the one and only time I felt alive while doing it. Maybe because emotions were I loved and I truly liked spending time with them but other than that. Ever since that relationship ended, sex in general is gross to me. Especially knowing all the diseases people can carry. I just don't see myself doing it again. The last couple of times that I did, I had to be drunk. Since I'm living sober now, I have absolutely no thoughts of hooking up or being physical with anyone. 
In my mind it's okay but actually doing it? No no.

You could possibly be asexual. Nothing wrong with that. Honestly life is too short to be doing things you don't enjoy. Never worry about fitting in or thinking something is wrong with you. If anything it's a great thing you wonder about yourself. Keep learning and live a beautiful life :) || Have you considered that it could be a fetish? For example, maybe you get off to watching others? Like a cuckhold or voyeurism fetish? || I absolutely feel like this few years back I used to think that this is gross until I realize it normal and when I see people doing it , it does feel gross and sometimes it doesn't,  but imagining myself in that position is horrifying , preganecy horrify me too || I feel the same to , i masturbate to people having sex all the time , but when i imagine myself doing it , it feels gross and revolting || You might be asexual, but might also be repulsed with your own body, and that would be dysphoria. Test whichever it is by imagining yourself in a body that you find attractive having sex. || i have the exact same thing || I’m the exact same way || Might be deep unconscious problem before the ages of memory formation… || It's not weird, but maybe you have some shame connected to sex? How were you brought up with the subject? || I'm not taking anything right now || Well welcome to the club :) 
The only advice I can give is Asexuallity. Second if you care about this then therapy. :)",1753768398.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc3k8c/is_it_weird_to_think_sex_is_gross_but_only_when_i/,mentalhealth

I don’t want to be appreciated solely for my achievements. I want to be attractive. I want someone to want me and love my appearance, not tolerate me despite it. 

Sometimes I feel like everything I’ve done and achieved will never matter, because I’m still the physically ugly, repulsive kid that I started off as. I don’t want to be a personality pick for a future partner. I don’t want to keep feeling like no matter how much I develop myself, I’ll always be behind someone naturally more attractive who could easily pick up those same hobbies, or work for those same achievements. 

I know this all sounds super shallow, sorry. I just hope someone relates, or has any advice on how to get out of these thoughts beyond “work on yourself” because believe me I’ve been doing all that (including extensive therapy) ","Frm what ihv understand u r so keen to hving tht ""attractive "" face tht u hv loss urself in the process of ""atleast im good at stuff even if im not tht attractive"" ...but deep down u still struggle with it ...ur coping mechanism was shiiii..in short n simple ...first learn to love urself ...learn stuff coz u like it not just for ""compensation"" ....ik u can do this...and trust me the right person will love you who you are...🫳 || Everyone has a different take on what being attractive means. Looks like your take is based on looks. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that. Some people gravitate to character, some people gravitate towards looks. It’s different strokes for different folks. The beauty about being open to interpretation is there’s some quality about everyone that another person likes out there. I guarantee there’s people who have liked you in both aspects without you even knowing. Everyone has something special about them.  || Yeah you might be right. It’s hard to figure out how to practice self love. I’m doing meditation and affirmations but maybe just need to be more patient til it clicks 

I do like what I do at least, I think I was just hoping deep down it would help me regulate and deal with emotional triggers",1753784274.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7nn8/i_dont_want_to_be_loved_for_my_personality/,mentalhealth
Anyone else feel like they’re not sad just permanently emotionally numb?,"Its not crying or breaking down or feeling hopeless its just blank, like being stuck in neutral.   
  
Things happen but nothing really lands, good news doesnt excite you, bad news doesnt shake you. You go through the motions get things done maybe even laugh sometimes but its like theres a thin layer of glass between you and everything else. Not dramatic just distant,anyone else know that feeling?","I know the feeling. Anhedonia. || I've felt this way especially since 2020 (pandemic). Likely that feeling was growing before 2020, and I'd say in the last year or so has really reached a peak where I just feel ""emotionally-empty"". (like an empty gasoline tank). I have physical and mental energy to do things (run errands, pay. bills, etc).. but my emotional pool to actually care or have sympathy or empathy for others is just absent. 

I'll do anonymous stuff,.. like when I go down to the apartment buildings ""Laundry Room"",. I'm the guy who brings down Clorox wipes and paper towels and while my laundry is going, I'll sweep the floor and wipe out Dryer lint traps and just generally pickup and tidy things up. (generally when nobody else is around). But I'm kind of doing that ""anonymously"" to help everyone. 

If it's a situation in front of my where an actual human needs an emotional response from me.. I just struggle to express anything. || Look up ""depersonalization"" and ""derealization"". 
I remember how confusing it all was when it started, and how much I panicked about feeling this way...but thankfully, you're not alone, and there IS a word for what you're going through :)
Let me know if you have any specific questions! Good luck on your research! || I feel the same as well. Even the happiest moments feel like obligations that i just have to get over with. I cant seem to feel my feelings anymore and everything is just numb. I’ve tried to search up online for why this happens and turns out it’s because of emotional burn out and dissociation. Its when you’ve been through prolonged stress where u just feel emotionally burnt out and dissociation is when u feel disconnected from your reality and its a coping mechanism for your body due to extreme stress and trauma || it’s like living in one dimension, like a flat world where there’s sensory input but where does it lead?

I’ve read numbness, surprisingly, is not from inability to feel, but from feeling too many at once that it become paralyzing to decode. Like too many colors mashed together to form the color “black”

So I hope that’s good news. Nothings wrong with you, maybe what you could use some is simply time off and some long walks to ease off the cortisol and stress and let your mind wander and hopefully gather some information that’ll inform you some possible feelings that’s in your chest, stomach, scalp, shoulders, jaw, feet or knees etc. etc., like a low targeted full body scan, gradually gradually I hope regaining you feelings || Yep. Absolutely. My wife just learned recently that I use to have a horrible temper before we met and was shocked.  I guess I've been hollow for much longer than I thought... || Yes. || The brain doesn’t go numb.

It just stops receiving emotional confirmation from the outside.

When no signal comes in… the system assumes it’s dead. || Yes, I feel this. It's like you're living life on mute, present, but not really there. You're not alone in that fog. || Yep. Been like that for 7 months. But it was after a very traumatic episode. Been flat ever since. || Sounds psychadelic but way less fun || It's just worse each year passing like running water , I usually don't even remember what I did whole 6 months and times passing way fast , I don't clean or even think about my parents Don't even call them , ruined my college entrance exam (it was weird fear or anxiety I was having while thinking of clg and life after like I can't do anything ) some times I do things when bo one looking at me , but in actual when someone needs me I do nothing 

My sis always scold about why I Don't think of cleaning my room by myself when I tell her it's just Don't come into my mind that's why I Don't do it , it's just I don't know why I don't do it myself she scolds me and thinking about what I'm becoming I feel more distress , today my mom wasn't picking up call she left for some work in another city that is about 700km+ and it  didn’t cross my mind to call her or even think of her when she didn't pickup phone ,I got scolded again 

Now I'm feeling like crying everything seems negative around me I feel like I want to shut myself off and meet no one , but I fear I may not call my mom and dad and sis if I got to college I maybe forgot about them , I was wondering if I should manage a diary and write things I have to do 

Everything feel like shit , and then on the other hand it feels nothing but empty 

I feel like all the things I'm looking at is movie and I'm watching this movie from distance where the voices and visual are dim or the voices are faint and i'm only looking at picture unable to make sense of it, what's happening 

I feel like crying I wish I had got a better cllg last year I though let's give a chance maybe thing will go away but now I Don't know , the more hopelessness I see around the more hopeless i feel , looking at couples and their babies suffocate me thinking about what have happened between them to reach that point and  then giving birth that is painfull or any kind of romantic things 


Everything suffocating me at some point and then it's blank ...... || Yeah, I’ve been feeling like this for a while now. It’s not anxiety and it’s not quite depression either, I’m familiar with those. It’s been getting a bit better of late but I still feel like…I’m under a slab of ice or something, and things that might otherwise make me laugh or whatever are bouncing off it. I’ll see a funny photo or whatever and my lips refuse to move, my whole face stays still. And it’s not even like all of my favourite things to do or whatever are rendered grey and lifeless, they just feel…muted. My job involves a lot of emotional labor and listening to people’s trauma and absolutely none of it is affecting me like I thought it would. Which might be a blessing some days, but as I’ve said, it’s not just work. Everything I do feels like a great going through the motions. 

I hope this is only temporary. For all of us. || Yes I’ve felt exactly like that and it’s one of the hardest things to explain to people who haven’t been through it. It’s not sadness or even hopelessness it’s more like your emotions have just gone quiet. You can function, laugh at the right moments, go about your day but there’s this dullness under everything like your heart is on mute. It’s like your brain decided it’s safer not to feel anything than to risk feeling too much. For me it started after a long period of stress and emotional burnout and it stuck around longer than I expected. What helped was realizing this isn’t unusual and it doesn’t mean I’m broken it’s often just how the nervous system protects itself. Therapy helped me slowly reconnect with myself emotionally even if it was uncomfortable at first. You’re not alone in this and just the fact that you’ve put it into words means there’s still a part of you that’s reaching for something better. || That's how I've been feeling recently.
Situations and things that used to make me happy or enthusiastic feel like nothing now, they don't bring any happiness.
Food and drinks I loved have no flavour and appear to be only the source of calories.

Situations and behaviours of others that would make me angry or frustrated are just being ignored and accepted. || 

Close enough || Thank you for sharing. I feel some elements of this too. I’ve found that I have less and less energy to do errands, it just feels daunting for some reason. Whenever I follow through, I feel happy or content. || This exactly.  Thank you for explaining that in a way that I unfortunately relate 100% || Can't it be without stress and trauma.......I don't have trauma and I think I don't take stress , I feel or imagine scrachting my head wildly , a sec of clip of my scrachting ,hitting goes on and then off like a trigger warning trandition videos || That's the way it is for me.

What i'd want if I was Critically injured in America without Healthcare,"If I were to be critically injured in America while not having healthcare... i'd rather pass on while being cared for... than survive to see the medical bill.

...Unfortunately, a lot of Americans feel the same. I guess this is where a lot of our mental health is at now in regards to receiving healthcare.

A lot of Republicans support this... they're all for stripping away healthcare...","American with limited access to Healthcare here. Tell me about it. I gotta basically pretend everything is fine and normal because I cant afford insurance, doctors who don't require insurance require hundreds to thousands up front before the start of treatment, and I cant afford most of the prescriptions for anything now. So I smoke as needed for pain, trying to learn plant medicine for what I can control, and just living with the fact that one day it will be too painful to not seek an exit in secret. It sucks. I don't really know what to do anymore besides pretend. 


Edited - felt more negative and personal than necessary  || If you have a serious injury, tell the hospital that you don't have insurance. Most states mandate pretty big discounts for those who don't have insurance. If they don't, hospitals tend to charge you far less if they know you're uninsured as a) there's no use asking you for a ridiculous fee you can't pay and b) they already make a ton of money by overcharging insurance companies, who can afford to pay the obscene bills because they're government subsidized. If it's still too high, call the hospital to see if you can negotiate the price down.

In the USA, it's the underinsured who get screwed the most because most discounts are designed to protect the uninsured, not the underinsured, meaning that if you have coverage that doesn't cover the procedure you got, there is no discount for you. || I can relate to the "" rather  pass on"" part.
I have a lot of pain that  really cant be fixed. I have a broken vertibre in my neck.
I have arthritus everywhere. I had a hip replacement. But the rest of my leg is so bad, I still can't use that leg. I also have really bad neuropathy around ny left ear. It feels like I'm being stabbed in my ear with an electric ice pick. But passing on isn't so easy to do. I wish there was more liberal assisted suicide in this country. It's difficult to commit suicide. The majority of people just mess themselves up worse than they were but still live. || Not a political sub || i feel you... it's sad to say, but even with insurance i don't know if you'd be doing much better.... i'm on medicaid, but i'm disabled by chronic pain & chronic illness, & it feels like no doctor cares to actually help... & now i have medical trauma, on top of all the other trauma i already had... & that glowing red exit sign only seems to get more enticing as my pain worsens... || Oh no..I feel so sorry for you....I think you should consider moving to Canada or something. Very similar to America in terms of demographic etc but they have free healthcare ( though actually being able to use it is another thing entirely ) but still better than murica || The more I read and learn everyday and weeks about healthcare status and fails in the USA the more I'm thankful for being in a country with virtually the best healthcare of the globe (from what I know it is) || Healthcare isnt political. || Well republicans and fascist are choosing to take away our healthcare , so mental health is being politicized whether you like it or not . || Open your eyes to the world, I'm not American (thank god because healthcare doesn't exist there) but even me and others like me can agree on what OP is saying || ill edit it to make it more mental health related... i maybe made the mistake of assuming that me wanting to pass on as oppose to dealing with medical bills had enough relativity to mental health. || It is . A lot of Americans can't afford healthcare for therapists or medication like me so they just stop cold turkey and don't get medical help because it's too expensive. I can't even tell you how many times I've tried to end my life and my mom told me to wait it out or forced me to put my fingers down my throat to vomit because she was a single mom and when I was still living with her we couldn't afford healthcare.",1753767589.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc3c41/what_id_want_if_i_was_critically_injured_in/,mentalhealth
Is it normal to have no consistent personality?,"I don't mean like minor things like changes in hobbies I mean my sexuality, how I talk, how I walk, my religious beliefs, my favourite shows, my voice, my feelings towards friends,my aspirations, my routines even my literal food tastes (all of these things that I notice and others have pointed out on multiple occasions).

I stay the same for a month MAYBE two and then I'm someone else entirely and I can't even empathise with that past me? Like complete emotional amnesia (and sometimes actual event amnesia but super super rarely so I'm not worried about that). I make new friends and create social medias and then have to delete them because not a single post is accurate not because I was lying at the time but because I will wake up and just not be the same person? The only time I've ever seen anything that resembles what it feels like is Mickey 17.

I moved around a lot when I was younger so for a while I just thought I was blending in with new environments but the past couple of years I've been at university and am entering my final year so I've stayed in the same place and it's still to the point people who I knew a couple months ago can't recognise me. If anything I think it might be getting worse.

Until I figure out what's going on I vowed to just stop making friends because it feels so unfair to them. They make friends with a version of me that will cease to exist in a couple months because the general inconsistencies in what I like and what we may have bonded over gets to be too great.

Narcissists can have empathy and not be abusive,"Idk why y’all act like your just instantly a bad person Becouse you have narcissism like going through the criteria you can be a good person and a narcissist. Becouse you need only 5 criteria.and y’all act like grandiosity is a bad thing

grandiosity is  litterally there so you don’t do anything bad from hating yourself so much

if a narcissist abuses you thats Becouse they are abusive not Becouse they are a narcissist people who have been abused can always become abuser whether they are a narcissist or not the disorder isn’t the broblem „narcissistic abuse“ doesn’t exist

narcissists get abused and have the disorder from getting abused ","Grandiosity is certainly a bad thing, it’s a lack of realistic self perception and it’s putting yourself above others. Nothing good can come out if that, and using it as a coping mechanism is not an excuse.

Yea, it’s very much possible to be a narcissist and don’t be abusive towards others. However, the traits a narcissist displays are very likely to cause suffering for others. It takes a lot of work for a narc to be functioning in relationships. || I empathize with their situation but I’d rather not be friends or find myself in a position where I have to interact with them. || For the love of god, please start using punctuation. I felt so stupid trying to read your post and comments || My ex-husband was not abused, in fact the complete opposite. Soooo… || I don't know if they can be a good person, I would never let myself be involved with one in my life. Those people are (mostly) poison. They are selfish to the point they can't think about anybody but themselves and have this mental distorsion in which they seem to believe the world revolves around them, sorry but no thanks. || How do we fix it? My partner is only a narcissist when he's on drugs idk what to do whilst he's currently on them || it’s pretty unlikely for narcissists to be genuinely empathetic and not emotionally abuse themselves and/or others. sure it’s a possibility, but placing yourself or others on a pedestal is going to create an unhealthy impact. || Grandiosity can also just be you actually being able to do smth but Another person did it too and you thinking your better then them even though you’re the same there are less extreme versions of narcissism || And that’s okay as long as you don’t demonize it and say all of them are evil and will m(rder you in your sleep or smth || what. || Yeah drug induced narcissism exists but Thats not NPD I suggest trying to get him to not take drugs as that is generally a good thing unless it’s medical drugs in wich case you should ask his doctor to change the prescription and I’d say good proffesionall Help but always be careful with these kinds of disorder medical gaslighting is a broblem or the doctors not understanding || I honestly have a hard time interpreting what you are trying to say. || Im saying that yeah grandiosity is bad but it’s also Not Evil and there exist smaller forms of grandiosity || the problem with grandiosity is that people in this state brutally overestimate themselves and cause harm. 

Their low self esteem also needs to put people down and harm people. 

Their grandiosity prohibits them from stopping to harm other people because if they wouldnt dismiss others feelings constantly, they would reflect and do things differently. 

So it takes a conscious narcissist to be a good one but thats sadly rately the case. || For sure. There are different scales. And many people who are not narcs has had thoughts of grandiosity at some point. I know I have. And I don’t think it’s evil, but it’s not a constructive way to view the world in. It only causes separation and in some cases hurt others. || They don’t have to put people down Becouse they can have empathy and feel bad grandiosity is just thinking you’re better you can still treat people under you good like even when your a boss or smth you don’t have to abuse you employes || I agree with that actually",1753790440.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc9i5s/narcissists_can_have_empathy_and_not_be_abusive/,mentalhealth
How do you explain your mental health struggles to people who don’t understand?,"It’s not always easy to find the right words when someone’s never felt what you’re feeling  
You try to explain but it either gets dismissed or misunderstood  
Sometimes it feels like you’re defending your pain instead of just sharing it  
Mental health isn’t always visible but that doesn’t make it less real  
How do you explain something invisible to people who only trust what they can see?","I don't. Unfortunately a lot of people don't have the capacity to understand something that they haven't personally gone through. || I’m in the camp of take it or leave it. I have this. Because if i do this. 

If they want to ask more questions in answer. Otherwise they take it or leave it. It’s my mental health not theirs. 

If they can be supportive or at the very least understanding perhaps they shouldn’t be in my life. || There’s a difference between people who make the effort to try to understand you and people who don’t care to understand. The first deserves patience, the second doesn’t deserve you. Learn to discern the people who want to be supportive, and be willing to teach them how they can help you. They are not mind readers.  || Tha kfully I'm a peer support specialist, so I have the ability to ro break down that tower of stigma by self disclosing. It's trial and error, though, and you don't trauma dump all your struggles at once when sharing your recovery story. Thr point is to help our clients see that there s light and we are their with them through thick and thin of the depths of recovery. || I don't really. My family doesn't believe in it unless you can see it. Down Syndrome or something like that. They believe that you can just ""get over it"" or ""pray it away"", you can't win with people like that. It makes my mental health worse to try and convince them of anything. || Let them misunderstand.  Not everyone is meant to know. If they're so healthy, they'll understand and accept that you have issues regulating. Sometimes music is a good communication though. If people ask me what my internal environment is, I give them the link to The Bridge City Sinners video of ""Doubt."" It's the best example I've ever found for myself.

It is normal to feel like this? Do I need to reach out?,"To preface, I've already spoken with my doctor about anxiety and depression, for which I was given resources and a temporary group on Mindfulness, which gave me some coping mechanisms, but the effectiveness for me seems to have plateaued. 

For the past 2 years or so, especially ramping up over the past year, I've felt it incredibly difficult to feel anything. Most of the time.

I feel so disconnected from myself. I struggle to take care of my needs. I feel a complete apathy to my own wellbeing, I think at least partially because I find it hard to remind myself that I'm a person at all.

Everyone around me looks so vibrant. I feel lucid as an observer, but I find myself physically forgetting that I'm a person too. 

My own name feels hollow. I find it practically impossible to imagine my future self. My memories of my past feel like I'm remembering a different person.

I have no will or drive to do things any more. I can't focus even on video games, movies, reading. The joy and passion that I used to have just feels absent.

Externally I do my best to stay optimistic, helpful, and seem functional. But I feel like it's nothing more than an act. A coping mechanism to keep myself alive.

Especially with the way the world is going, trans rights taking blows, freedom of information restricting. It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller. Like the world itself is starting to choke at my neck, and I can't breathe any more. 



I know burnout and at least some levels of depression are ""common"" especially with younger generations. But I'm really fighting with the idea of maybe reaching out to try and get some help. But I'm not sure how much of this is in my head, and how much might require actual help.

i don’t really know what emotions i’m feeling,"I (15, f) usually don’t post here, i’ve only posted once before on my other acc. I don’t even know why i’m posting this or what i’m expecting honestly. Last time i posted, i met an amazing person but also got a lot of gross responses, so.

This isn’t only or mainly about EDs and i don’t go into really any detail, but it was the most fitting tag.
I feel so empty? I don’t feel totally sad tho, just weird like that. I’m bored with everything. Not even the internet is fun anymore. I’d like to just sleep 24/7. I don’t feel depressed tho? i genuinely don’t know. 

Technically i have a lot of not so great shit that went/is going down in my life but it’s all just stuff that i’m used to or kinda accepted so it shouldn’t make me feel like this.
My father is in rehab (again), i’m struggling with two of my friendships, i keep dreaming of bad things, i’m stuck in a binge & restrict cycle, i hate the way i look lately more than usually and i keep thinking and feeling gross about what i used to do with older men online, at the same time i keep missing one of the guys i used to talk to. 
i hate typing that out because i feel like i’m just self pitying honestly.

I don’t know what to end this with or what to ask or anything like that. 
It’s not like anyone can magically “help” me. Maybe i just wanted to type it out, maybe i thought this would help my boredom or maybe i just want to talk to random people on the internet. 

I’m thinking of going to therapy again, but i used up the free sessions you get in my country when you’re young and i don’t want to burden my mom with paying for therapy where i probably won’t even talk about what truly bothers me.

"i thought the police were after me, what could this be??","soo on my street recently there was a drug bust (well that's what me and my friends, admittedly mainly my friends, think it was)
and for some reason, i thought the police were after me specifically.

For context, there was a raid on my street. SWAT teams, dogs, and like 20 police cars.

the whole time the police were there, i watched, because something in my mind genuinely convinced me i was in trouble and going to be targeted.

the whole time i was rambling to my friends about being taken away or spoken to and things along those lines, i have 2 videos of my panicking and freaking the fuck out, and even getting ready to cry out of genuine fear that i was being targeted.

it (the raid) started at about 9pm maybe? and ended at about 12 am. i know this because - i was watching. i was making sure the police were not ""onto"" me (just to clarify, they have no reason to be onto me. i have done nothing illegal nor do i plan to do anything illegal, i'm only 16 i don't do much)

i slept on call with a friend because i was so shaken up.

genuine question, is this normal? do many people feel the same when witnessing things like this?

yes, i've had these sorts of feelings before. i've even avoided going outside, taped my windows shut, and taped the camera part of my devices before out of pure fear (back and front camera)
and yes these feelings end at some point, sometimes after a few hours or few days.

I(35M) am not sure how to navigate my partners(38F) trauma,"We’ve been seeing each other for a year and decided to make it official in March this year. We’ve talked about marriage and moving in together. However…

My partner tragically lost her father in puberty, and developed trauma. The closer we bond, the deeper she pushes me away to avoid losing someone she loves.

She’s aware of her trauma and actively doing therapy.

I try to be as patient as possible and give her a sense of safety the best way I can. Nonetheless, I struggle to understand how to navigate this. The deeper our love, the closer I get, the more fear gets activated and she pushes me back.

She’s a smart and loving woman. Never mean, not manipulative, not testing me, very loyal. I’m aware it will be a ride and I’m in for it. I am also aware it’s her job to heal her trauma, but is there anything I can do? All that comes natural when loving someone seems to have the opposite effect of what we desire.

Any feedback welcome.

Will meds help with my anger?,"So, I’d been on sertraline for some time before I stopped taking it, because I’m bad at taking meds consistently these days. I’d really say I don’t need it other than my bursts of anger.

It’s unusual, but being spoken down to constantly at work, not being able to do certain tasks, etc, leaves me so angry I’m often hitting my desk, myself, I’ve ripped notebooks apart and broken headsets at work without even realising because I’m pulling something too hard. I kept an old broken desk chair now that I’ve replaced it because I knew it would be better than hitting things, but got a bit of a shock when it bent the object I was using to hit because must’ve been going too hard.

I hate it. I’m so overwhelmed by it that I physically can’t hold it in and end up physically hurting myself or damaging things around me, but I’ve never had this problem before, and I don’t know if taking my meds (Zoloft) is actually going to help any or just put me through the awful side effects of starting again for no reason.

I walk thousands of steps everyday and it's not in my control,"26m, I walk thousands of steps in my room and it's not in my control. I walk so much that my legs start to hurt and I still can't stop. People arround have start to notice and they think somethings wrong with me. My friend once asked ""why I always walk in my room whenever he sees me"" and I was like ""I'm just thinking about something"". But I still can't explain why can't stay still.


       One time in office we were in middle of a team meeting and I started thinking about something. Few minutes later I stood up and started walking in the meeting room in middle of meeting. Everyone just looked at me and were like ""what the hell is he doing?"" I said ""I'm just stretching my legs"" and everyone laughed it off. But really I forgot that I was in a meeting and people were arround me. It was pretty embarrassing for me. Why do I do this?

Tired of people telling me it's temporary,"I have been so depressed my entire life. Not a day I remember since age 5 where I didn't think of the end. And I have tried every single day to find reasons to keep going so I don't hurt others. I constantly remind myself to try something else, one more day, one more try. But I'm so sick of my depression being framed in terms of how other people might feel. If those people might feel so strongly why then do they not help while I'm still here? Is my pain only important as it relates to others who aren't depressed? 

And I'm so absolutely tired of being told that my depression is temporary. I'm med resistant apparently, most medications I've been on have never had the intended effect. I've been in and out of therapy and psychiatry with more negative impact on my life than positive. And still I try. I was even sent a book where a psychologist writes over and over that most depression ends in a few months or with treatment (the book is good and he's right about a lot of things with regard to other people but the more I read, the more I get the impression that it wasn't written for me). I'm 36 years old, not a full length of life maybe but 31 years of days taken up by wishing to be done is too much. I never asked to exist. Life has been too painful for too long. When my therapist goes home at the end of the day and enjoys time with her family, I'm still alone at home every hour of every day until I see her next, scraping the walls of my skull looking for any motivation to keep going, and coming up short. 

What's the god damn point? I've never had dreams or life goals that mattered long term. When asked I usually just create a 'goal' based on the moment. It never holds. Treatment continues to provide empty promises. Continuing to try, no matter what or how hard, has only prolonged things at best and created even more problems at worst. 

If you're reading this and comparing me to yourself I hope you'll take more cues from someone who's benefited from treatment than from me. I'm not even a good example when I'm doing everything I can. The only future in life that seems likely for me is that I live miserable for the rest of my natural days and frankly, I have little interest in that. ","**Hello u/!**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/mentalhealth) if you have any questions or concerns.* || I like to focus on small pleasures to help me get through the tough times. Like every morning I look forward to my cup of coffee. It doesn't sound like much, but taking time to appreciate the taste and warmth and peace helps me get grounded. 

Not every situation with depression is the same. A lot of advice is for the ""average"" depression experiencer, yours seems more severe so it makes sense that that provides a disconnect for you. 

Was your childhood rough? Have you really dived deep into the traumas that may have led you to this point? Maybe you have trouble setting goals due to deeply ingrained ideals you had to have to survive to this point. 

A big thing that helped me was diving into philosophy as well. I really like Alan Watts to start. It really helps you dive into the ""What's the point?"" In all of it. 

I hope some of this helps and if not, I hope someone else has some advice to help. Know you're not alone and it can get better. Its not hopeless. || I've looked hard at the events in my life that brought me to where I am. My life hasn't been as hard as many, on paper, but no shortage of trauma either. But my depression came before most all of the awful things that followed. The little things help in the short term but when the enjoyment is minimal and ultimately giving diminishing returns down to none at all, what else is there to focus on? || It doesn't have to be a particular event to cause the initial depression. It could have some genetic component as well. That doesn't mean it can't get better though. 

Maybe you'll benefit more for going big picture then. Super big picture, like how did it all even begin? It helps your struggles seem smaller and more manageable and can help give you a purpose. Alan Watts videos really helped me get started on that has changed my perspective on life that really helped me but its not for everyone. Are you religious at all? I might shift my advice if you are as there are some options there too.

I know this is cliche, but make sure you're getting sunlight and fresh air as well. I work from home and my depression flares up more when I forget to leave the house for a week. Try to make sure you're eating and moving. It doesn't fix it, but it helps.

It helps me to focus on experiences. Like going to the Farmers Market or something small, you dont even have to buy anything. Just soak up different atmospheres. 

Full disclosure: I also use medication to help with my depression. I understand you're medication resistant so I haven't really mentioned it but it could be a factor in what's working for me || Not religious at all. 

Struggling with anxiety made me agoraphobic even with ongoing treatment. I do go out though, I get sun and I commit to my treatment plan for immersion therapy and all. I take walks when I can manage. I take vitamin d supplements by prescription, though it hasn't affected my mood at all. 

I don't feel any better no matter what scale I look at things from. Big picture stuff used to add to my stress because, having no long term goals I cared about, I always felt like a failure. It's a reminder of where I'm at and how I feel all the time, that my trajectory has never been positive and I don't have means to change it. Small picture at least provides less anxiety, though obviously no comfort. Breaking my problems up into smaller chunks has helped me work on some of them, but again, no meaningful change to my depression.",1753797531.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcc6h0/tired_of_people_telling_me_its_temporary/,mentalhealth
feeling like a part of my body isn’t mine,"hi i was just very lost and needed to share some thoughts and things i have been dealing with lately and ask what it could be and if i should find a doctor asap or if its not that bad?? im so unsure of what to think

I have been dealing with depression basically since my early teens due to a traumatic event but it was actually getting better. i am now about to turn 23, i am the happiest i have ever been i wouldn’t even say i am depressed but  i have had 2 big crisis that were nothing like i experienced before. i felt brutally pulled out of my body and for the whole day and night, i have been hyper, idk how to describe it but like, i couldnt stop moving around and i felt on fire in a way. im not even sure i knew what i was thinking about during it, i felt totally disconnected from myself, i felt like i had no control on my actions. and during the 2nd one of those crisis i suddenly started to obsess ofer two of my fingers, they felt wrong and i was so sure they weren’t mine like at all. it got so bad that all i could think about was that i needed to find a way to remove them or that the feeling or whatever were inside them would spread on the rest of my hand\arm…. i ended up doing some damage to them but nothing too bad and felt physically exhausted so i fell asleep at 5am and when i woke up i felt like the crisis had stopped.

My issue is, those crisis were so scary to me, i have never experienced that. and since then my extremities like my hands mainly and my legs have started to feel weirdly weak and tingly and i keep hearing the sound of my front door opening or closing\slamming shut. i have also with my body feeling tingly i noticed the floor at times move in a weird way? like waves or just wiggle? sorry i cant find the word i want in english… And also today the feeling about fingers has slowly started to come back i feel like, it has been 1 week since that crisis but i started to focus on them again and they started to bother me and i am scared that it means it will happen again. 

I am sure it sounds dumb and ridiculous but i am genuinely starting to feel like im loosing it. I am conflicted because writing it down i feel like everything is silly and i know those are my fingers for example but it still actively feel like they arent. sorry for that long useless post i had nowhere to put that so i deceded to come on here",Well seek for therapy thts the best u can do...I'll pray for you || Yeah i just called and i have an appointment next monday.

I haven’t left my house in months… how do you rebuild a life when your body reacts like this?,"Sorry for the long post and vocab. I find it hard to communicate.
 
I(26M) have been an ambitious kid since forever. I want to be a filmmaker. Not only that, but i want to have enough wealth that i am able to travel all over the world with my family without any sacrifice, like traveling business class, experiencing the best of the best hotels, food, etc. But with that I'm unwilling to travel. Even the thought of going somewhere gives me severe anxiety that is very unbearable. Even going local my body goes so tense that when i reach back home, body releases relief farts. And when i travel espacially in a car, i have groggy stomach. These feelings have been there since i can't even remember. Initially i wanted to travel the world, become a travel host for some show in fox travels etc. But i don't know how and when i got like these. In contrast to that my parents are very quick on their toes when it comes to traveling. They would be ready for any frequent plans tho my mother doesn't like frequent local outing. Whenever they make any plan i always refuse for which they make fun of me. Sometimes them making plans make me very angry and an uncontrollable anger comes out of nowhere demotivating them. As you know filmmakers require a lot of travelling but since i can't do any, it also makes me anxious for the future. In the past i went to delhi(tier 1 city) for a year leaving my hometown chandigarh(tier 2 city) to pursue my career, but i had to drop everything and come back. Not only psychological but also physical health wise i was incompetent for which i has to face the repercussions in the form of various health problems and deficiencies. But even that time was not able to change me and fix my fear of going out. I used to be very home sick and suffer a lot.
It's been 3 months since i got back from delhi but since then I've hardly left my house 3-4 times, that too for my dental appointment. I suffer from general anxiety 24/7 but this travel anxiety is extreme for me to handle. In addition to that, tho this is just assumption that it might connect. I feel a similar or less like of anxiety when someone, even the regular house help comes at home or people surrounding me in general. The more unfriendly faces i see the more closeted i feel. My behavior changes and i can't wait for everybody to leave or when i am outside the anxiety i feel is significantly reduces when i sit back in my car and is fixed with that relax fart when i reach home. What do you think I can do to fix this?

Pulling back,"I blocked this woman on here that I have been messaging with. Our connection is electric- flirty, interesting, with common hobbies, teasing. She is so intelligent and insightful and funny. She feels it too. At least from what she says. But she has also made it clear she has her own issues to work through and cannot offer much more connection than messages here.  At least for now.

I felt I started to be overwhelming. Messaging her more than she was responding. Being more flirtatious, more complimentary, more romantic with my words. I was composing french poetry. I don’t know how to do either portions of that phrase. It had to be mania. I got worried I would scare her off. So I decided to shield her with this block.

This behavior has to be a mania. I am right now unable to afford or get my meds. No money, no car. I can't see a therapist/psychologist for the same reasons. Due to a previous psychotic episode I just wrapped up some legal issues. It went well. Thankfully. I am struggling with work politics. I have so few irl friends. My ex-husband just moved out. I am having tension with my mother at the same time my father is struggling healthwise. I just realized I was gay in February after a lifetime of intense internalized homophobia. It is a lot so it would make sense I am out of control.

Before I blocked her I sent her a message and left it for about 12 hours. I hope she saw it. I just separated from a codependent marriage of 8 years. To man. Again, I just realized I was gay in February.

When I lay it all out like this, there are so many factors going against me. Against the possibility of pursuing this woman. What I have told and more. I just. My chest hurts with the thought of lossing forever the possibility of having found my person.

I wish I was healthier so I could move forward with my life. So that I could be more present for her. Give her the support and make space for her. She has struggles as well. I would be there for her. But my own issues swirl around me, and I don’t want to throw them on her.

Struggling to keep up with daily life,"Hi all, I am a 24F currently working part time and in school full time. My partner 24M is very supportive and we’ve been together for a long time, so they have seen me at my worst and my best. I have been on medication for over 2 1/2 years and the current combo I have for a year. Over the last few months I noticed myself falling deeper into my depression and specifically, anxiety. I have accommodations at my school, so I get some flexibility with my coursework and I’ve been able to keep up with that. However, I am so anxious all the time. I am anxious to go to class, I am anxious about work, I have barely been able to manage going to the grocery store. I take my medications regularly, and on time, but I can’t seem to get past this skin crawling feeling I have all the time. If I don’t feel anxious, I am foggy. Things slip past me and I lose hours of time just curled in a ball on my bed. I’ve neglected my regular hygiene and I just feel so out of my body.

Over the last week, I haven’t been able to sleep, I eat when I feel anxious, and I can’t keep up with my work tasks. At work, I fell behind a few weeks ago and had a meeting with my supervisor. I was able to catch back up, but just recently I missed an important appointment with a client who was already understanding enough to reschedule with me. I had not gotten back to them until today, to which I found out they went to my supervisor about it. I feel ashamed in myself because I had made so much progress in the last two years. I know I am going to be asked what happened, and having to explain my mental health episode just has me on a spiral. I am ashamed to tell my partner I messed up. 

I know I can’t jump to the conclusion that I will be fired, but I already feel so anxious about it since we have already had a discussion about my organization and time management. I have set up an apology and resignation email in case because I don’t think I can handle it. I am just struggling so much more than I wanted to recognize. I need some sort of job to support myself until I finish my degree this spring. I don’t know how to move forward.

Mom makes me go to a Chiropractor for OCD treatment,"I (17M) was diagnosed with OCD About a year and a half ago, as well as an eating disorder. Originally, I had a phycologist that helped walk me through my eating disorder, but she moved out of state about a year ago. Her treatment didn’t really work for me either, as she focused more on body positivity rather that the rituals and OCD-related thoughts I had (and still have) around eating. After her departure, I told my mother that I would rather see an OCD specialist due to their care being much more tailored towards my broader OCD symptoms outside of just food. We went to see a potential fit in December, but was told by him that my weight was too low to safely begin EMDR therapy. Since December, I have made it my mission to gain weight and have put on 25 pounds, giving me a healthy body weight for the first time in years. In between me gaining this weight and being barred from treatment, my mother (bless her heart) has found… alternative treatment options. Originally, we tried “neurofeedback” which did absolutely nothing to help me whatsoever, but was at least doable from home. After this failure, she went down an alternative medicine rabbit hole and became set on chiropractic care to cure my ailments. She makes us drive 45 minutes away from home to go to this “elite pediatric chiropractor” who adjusts mostly babies and toddlers (which I find upsetting because they are so young). I’ve been making her happy by going for about 4 months now, but have seen literally zero improvement in my condition (as I expected). The chiropractor keeps saying stuff like “oh it takes time” and “keep coming and you’ll see results” but I believe he’s just trying to keep customers coming back. I would love to try real OCD therapy again now that my weight his up, but would no longer like to go to the chiropractor. The issue is, my mom is dead set on me continuing treatment there despite there being literally no evidence of my condition improving. Is there any way I can let my mother down slowly and explain to her in a calm manner that chiropractic care is snake oil? Thank you so much! ","You’ve made impressive progress by reaching a healthy weight, well done! The fact that you’re now actively seeking proper treatment for your mental health also shows maturity and self-awareness. I'm proud of you!

It’s common for well-meaning parents to turn to alternative treatments like chiropractic care or neurofeedback when they feel unsure, but these approaches have no scientific basis for treating OCD and can actually delay meaningful progress.

You don’t need to argue or call it snake oil, but it’s fair to tell your mother that you gave it an honest try, it hasn’t helped, and you’re not comfortable continuing. That discomfort alone is a valid reason to stop. Let her know you’d like to take responsibility for your mental health by finding a qualified OCD specialist, either directly or through your GP.",1753795159.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcb8oo/mom_makes_me_go_to_a_chiropractor_for_ocd/,mentalhealth
How do you handle feeling like a burden when opening up to others?,Feeling like a burden is one of the hardest parts of opening up. It turns vulnerability into guilt.

I'm so sick of life,"I've always thought that killing myself is dumb because i will die someday anyway, so why not live while I can, but it's not that easy anymore. I'm doing everything healthy. Working out, eating healthy, going out with friends, I even had therapy, and know how to deal with my anxiety, but I'm just so tired of life. I really want to fall asleep and just never wake up. The pictures in my head of my body being found are getting more and suddenly I care less and less about the reaction of my friends and family finding out I'm dead. I don't plan to harm myself, but I wish I was just dead. I really want to be happy. I've done so many things to feel something, but I just don't. Everything is just another thing that happened. Be it the tattoo I finally got after years of wanting it, or the piercings I finally got. I don't experience joy anymore. I'm just so tired.","**Hello u/!**

Who would I be without my depression?,"Hey, I (f21) been trying to reflect a bit lately and wanted to know if somebody else has felt the way I have or has some thoughts to share. 

I have been feeling unwell for the past years, a few moths ago I started going to therapy and have been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. And to be entirely honest I’ve been struggling a lot, and feel like I’m not sure if I even want to get better, which must sound absurd…
Lately, I realised that I really don’t know who I am without my illness, or at all. And I am incredibly scared to get better and find it out. Of course it’s probably better than right know and I think I never really identified myself with those problems, but it’s just who I am and I don’t know anything else than feeling shit. I don’t remember who I was before feeling unwell and can’t imagine ever feeling better. 

TLDR: I don’t know know who I am without my mental illness, since I don’t know anything else, and am incredibly scared to find it out

Has anyone ever dealt with something similar? How did you manage…
","Hey, thanks for sharing this , what you’re describing really resonates with me. That fear of not knowing who you are without the illness, or the discomfort of even imagining a different version of yourself, is something I’ve been sitting with too. It’s like the pain becomes so familiar that it starts to feel like part of your identity, even if you never wanted it to be.

Lately, I’ve started keeping a journal to help untangle all of this. I’ve been trying to ask and actually answer the difficult questions I usually avoid, things like what am I afraid of? or what would it mean to let go of this version of myself? It’s uncomfortable, but it’s also helping me get a better understanding of how and why I feel the way I do. It doesn’t fix everything, but it’s been a gentle way to reconnect with myself beyond just the pain.

You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Healing isn’t always a straight path, and it’s okay to feel scared of the unknown.

What’s a silent symptom of mental illness that people don’t talk about enough?,It’s not always the big breakdowns or loud cries for help. Sometimes it’s the lack of motivation to do simple things like responding to a message or getting out of bed. It’s the fake smile in public followed by emotional shutdown in private. It’s the way someone zones out mid-conversation or avoids eye contact because their mind is somewhere darker. These signs often go unnoticed because they’re quiet but that silence doesn’t mean everything’s fine.,,1753794507.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcazf3/whats_a_silent_symptom_of_mental_illness_that/,mentalhealth
Struggling only about relationships,"Im a person who is a 27 year old female, having therapy for almost 3 years and recently recognized a pattern about myself. Whenever I have a problem or anxiety or depression or a really good time, any “extreme” feeling, it’s about romantic relationships and nothing else. If I don’t have a relationship, I just feel “normal”. For example if I got bored or just randomly feel bad, it’s just it and nothing else. But when I have relationship (and I almost always having one) and if I feel any minor discomfort in my body or in my mind, it’s about the relationship or correlates with that. 

This pattern made me think 2 things:

1-do I really don’t have any problems other then relationships? (Its not realistic and sounds not possible) 

2-if I have any other problems, why im not seeing them and making a mask with having a relationship?

Has somebody went through something like this? What do you think?

TLDR: I feel like im masking my “real” problems by thinking about my romantic relationships ",,1753794273.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcaw97/struggling_only_about_relationships/,mentalhealth
How do you guys figure out what meds are worth it when nothing is working?,"Genuinely curious how people make these decisions. I’ve been on and off different meds for months now while some helped a little, some made things worse, and some just did absolutely nothing?? It’s honestly exhausting trying to figure out what’s actually doing something and what’s just noise.

I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t even know what’s a symptom anymore and what’s a side effect. Like am I tired because of the condition or because of the med? Is the brain fog from my body or my treatment? It’s such a mess to untangle. Lately I’ve been doing everything I can think of like tracking symptoms every day, comparing notes with people who have similar issues, reading way too many Reddit threads, I even ran my med history through this online health tool EurekaHealth to see if anything would stand out and It actually flagged a few things I hadn’t thought about before but of course before giving me any medicine I need to consult with a doctor and that’s kind of the problem I haven’t found one who’ll really dig into it with me without just brushing me off.

Do you guys go off gut instinct? Give it a strict timeline or keep trying stuff until something feels right? I feel like I’m just throwing darts and hoping one finally hits the target. Would love to hear how you’ve approached it especially if you’ve been in that same nothing’s really working phase.","Here are a few suggestions:

Do you have any other family members that have successfully used psychiatric medication for mental health issues. Often there’s a genetic component to what works within family systems. Particularly between male/male and female/female patterns.

Have you looked at using psilocybin or MDMA assisted therapy. There may be groups that are practicing in your area. Or there may be trials that you can apply to. There is a lot of success happening with these types of therapeutic models. 

When was the last time you were checked for deficiencies? Vitamin B12, vitamin D, Iron - these are common deficiencies that can add to your feelings of depression, low energy, brain fog, etc.

Have you been meeting with a therapist? Is there any underlying unresolved trauma, any history of abuse or accidents. The brain body connection is so very real. Talk therapy is not the be all/end all but  it is an important part of your healing process❤️ || For me it took realizing my “treatment resistant depression” was actually bipolar II with hypomania so mild I never recognized it. Once I got on lithium as well as one the better antidepressants for me, it hasn’t “pooped out” like it and every other AD did. || Talk to your doctor. there are genetic tests called pharmacogenetic or pharmacogenomic tests—that can help predict how your body might respond to certain psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and stimulants. || I feel the pain. I can't count the number of meds I tried before getting on some that mostly help (yes I'm in a couple). One thing that I found helpful was getting a genetic test that indicates the likelihood you'll respond positively to different meds. At the very least it can help you avoid some that won't work. 

I did get lucky with the first med to help with my depression (Wellbutrin). It's consistently helped, and digging into it I found it can also help with ADHD (I didn't get a diagnosis until almost a decade after starting Wellbutrin).

I'd say if your gut says one's more likely than another, trust it. As far as getting a doctor on board, finding one that specializes in mental health care can help. Look into nurse practitioners as well because they'll often focus on specific areas even though they're primary care of family practice. I found an NP that did an amazing job at identifying the most likely to work combos. And with you already tracking and having the data, they'll probably even confirm what you've found. || It took about three years of hell trying different meds and side effects and feeling hopeless until I found a new psychiatrist who looked at my history and prescribed a new generation medication that mostly helped. I had to reframe my expectations and not have one medication take care of everything, but be medicated to the point where I can be functional. My depression was the biggest issue, and I was able to not be suicidal anymore, so that was a win. I still struggle with anxiety and emptiness and moodiness and various other things, but I'm grateful I'm not in the deep pits anymore. I just had to keep trying medication until I got out of that deep dark hole. Everything else I cope with now via therapy and people's support. To answer the question: meds are worth it for me to not actively want to off myself, everything else I deal with non medication. || What worked for me was trying different classes. For years doctors shuffled me back and forth between different brand SSRIs, SNRIs etc. for 9 years I thought I had treatment resistant depression. 

Thankfully one doctor was like let’s try an atypical one. Finally found that only NDRIs work for me. 

Drugs target different neurotransmitters. So basically my serotonin levels were normal (which is why ssri and snri didn’t help at all). My depression was due to norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter deficiencies || This is super thoughtful I hadn’t considered the family med angle or deficiencies tbh, but both make a lot of sense and yeah, I’ve been in and out of therapy but might need to revisit it with a different lens. really appreciate you taking the time to lay all this out. || I’ve wondered if something like that could be going on with me too, since nothing seems to stick.

Feeling Trapped and Controlled by Father Despite Some Financial Independence - Need Advice (F22),"

Hello Reddit, I'm a 22F, working part-time, and feel utterly trapped by my father's constant manipulative behavior. My brain hurts from the stress.

Here's what's going on:

Recently, old family friends (like extended family to me since childhood, bought me gifts, went on vacations) visited. I'd planned to rent an Airbnb and go to their village alone, but my friends gave excuses. The family friends then offered to take me for a few days, and I excitedly accepted.

However, after they left, my father exploded. He made a huge drama about money, how much it would cost him, and my ""arranging things without consulting him."" I'm not a child to ask for his permission; I've planned my trips through Europe without asking him. I just told him I'm going, he doesn't have the right to meddle in my business.

This is a recurring nightmare because:

I'm financially independent: I have significant savings from my part-time job. Money isn't an issue for me.

I cover most of my own education and activities:

Year 1: I paid 3/4, he had minimal participation.

Year 2: I paid 100%.

Year 3: He offered to pay the majority so I could save, but I still covered 1/4. Now, he constantly ""rubs it in.""

Year 4: I have half saved, working to cover it fully myself.

Beyond tuition, I've paid for all extracurricular activities, travels, seminars, and CV-building activities, even paying others for rides. It's not like he paid or supported me anything when I was a kid or teenager; everything I wanted to do or try, I paid for myself. I don't expect anything from him.
That's why it was strange to me when he said he wanted to pay for the school year, I thought he wanted to help me at least a little.

His manipulation: He constantly ""rubs it in""  now that he paid for the 3rd year (despite his original offer to help me save), and if I talk to my mom about enything , he jumps in screaming, assuming we want him to pay something without knowing any details.

His lack of support goes beyond finances. Last month, I walked 15km home from work late in the city during protests. After 10km, I called him for a ride. 15 minutes later, he called back asking if there was a night bus. I just walked the rest of the way. 

I can't live like this. Peaceful communication doesn't work  he just escalates. We have an apartment that belongs to him, but it's rented out, so I can't move there. Moving out would mean full-time work, which isn't possible if I want to attend university lectures. I even tried seeing a psychologist in secret, but that specific one wasn't a good fit, so I gave up.

I'm desperate. How do I cope with this toxic environment while saving and planning my exit? Any advice on handling his screaming/manipulation, or practical steps for someone in my situation, would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you.",,1753793622.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mcan7w/feeling_trapped_and_controlled_by_father_despite/,mentalhealth
"Are you supposed to have pervasive, constant emotions?","Fairly mild post here, it's just something I've been thinking about since roughly five hours ago. 

Hate. It was hate. I was thinking about how we feel and project hate. But...what is hate? It seems most congruent with anger, but it's not *just* the same thing, clearly. Hate seems to be much more pervasive. Anger is fleeting, but hate supposedly is always there. 

I came upon this topic because I realised that I couldn't really say I hate anyone. Like, people will say they hate [insert horrible person] even if they don't have anything personally to do with that person, but is that actually a lingering sentiment? Is there actually a feeling of hatred or is it just recognition of the idea that this person is deserving of hatred? 

It's not just hate though, disgust is another example. If you tell me you like eating your own excrement, I wouldn't be disgusted, I'd just consider you or this action disgusting, as in, it fits with what is generally considered disgusting and *would* probably evoke disgust if you did it in front of me. I might think that [insert horrible person] is a horrible person, but that isn't going to actually make me hate them. It's weird to say because it sounds callous, but that's not what I mean. It just doesn't really make sense, I'd probably be angry or afraid or something else if I was affected by [insert atrocities] but what actually is hate meant to be?

Am I overthinking this? Are such emotions just a way for us to describe our thoughts on things using established labels, i.e. ""I hate [insert horrible person]"" actually conveys ""I find [insert horrible person] to be horrible""? That would probably make sense. But some people seem to genuinely project some kind of internal feeling when they say such things, whereas that doesn't really change the message, does it?

 What about sadness? What does it actually mean to be sad about [insert tragedy]? Sure, in the moment it means either the tragedy or the memory of it is evoking sadness. But how does that linger? When you say you're always sad about something, does it mean that when confronted with it, it will evoke sadness consistently? Or would you say it's a lingering kind of thing?

I'm not sad about the death of my father. If I said that, it would have people thinking I'm a horrible person. I was sad when my father died, and certainly the thought that he died so young is something I can recognise as sad but it's passed. It doesn't affect me. Where would the feeling come from? For something potentially even more inflammatory: I couldn't say I ""hate"" Adolf Hitler. Horrible, right? But it's not like that means I consider him any less evil than you do. But that's an observation. Feeling emotions towards him would imply that I have some kind of interpersonal relationship with him, which I don't. 

And now I realised this is likely about two separate, if related issues:

1. The question of lingering or permanent, ""passive"" feelings

2. The question of emotions beyond a response to a specific stimulus 

To elaborate on number 2: Being angry when someone scams you makes sense. Being angry when someone scams your sibling also does. It directly affects you and thus stimulates certain emotions. But being angry at a stranger you've only heard of in the newspaper being scammed doesn't really make sense. Angry at the state of the world for allowing such things to occur, I suppose that makes sense. But aren't emotions something that merely flares up in a given situation?

Anybody else can’t hate others fully?,"like it doesn’t matter what they did, i just won’t be able to “hate” them. i don’t think i’ve ever understood people saying they want somebody dead or how they wish the worst for someone. just curious ","I used to feel the same until people don’t change and keep hurting me and others and now I just feel so much hate unfortunately || I agree. It is crazy to me seeing how easily people on the internet can hate others. I think if somebody is truly sorry for what they did I could forgive nearly anything, unless they like burnt my dog alive. || I used to feel that way, and generally speaking, I still do. But I found the capacity to truly hate when I grew up and became aware of how evil and selfish my country's leadership is, and I have no empathy or kindness toward people in power who use it to oppress and destroy. They could all die and I'd sleep better lmao. || I understand what you feel , i used to feel the same way to , that how can you hate someone so much you wish bad things for them , but then oneday something changed , and now i hate everyone i get to know, i dont want bad things to happen to them or for them to be sad , but i just hate everyone. || Hates a strong word...dissappointed is a better term. || I've never understood anger as an emotion. It's just sadness. I don't get the passion to hate someone. That's so much energy.

There's one person who's on sight that I will lay hands on. But it's cause she did something bad to someone else. Those who hurt me I have no ill will against. You harm a child, someone with a disability, someone weaker than you, then imma do what ever I can to protect them. || When I was young I thought I hated people, when you get older you realize that hating people takes time and energy. People I dislike are not worth my time and energy. I suppose if I was cheated on or someone hurt my family I could find some energy to hate them but that’s about it. || I feel the same, to an extent. 

I hate anyone who purposely and maliciously hurts animals just for the point of hurting them or just to make themselves feel better/stronger/etc. Especially if it's my pets. 

And I hate certain people in politics or in positions of power, who have caused so many people to be in so much pain. || I will never understand the depths of hatred it must take to actually kill or hurt someone. But I can absolutely feel anger and disappointment and resentment and disdain, and yes, even hate. 

My little sister’s ex-best friend was a piece of shit narcissist who abused her and made her feel terrible about herself for years, and let me tell you, I hate that bitch. 

God, I hate her. I can’t stand to hear her name, and I truly wish her the worst. Thankfully a lot of bastards like that have a tendency to ruin their own lives, and she was arrested last year for drunk driving, cocaine possession, and assaulting a police officer, which is when my sister finally woke up and realized she was hanging out with a lunatic who was only going to drag her down. 

Usually I’d feel bad for people struggling with mental health issues that affect their behavior, even if I don’t want anything to do with them for my own sake. But not her. She was a rich kid who went to private school and had everything handed to her. My parents know her parents, and they seem totally fine, there is no reason for her to act like this, no history of trauma or abuse or disadvantage that would make her act like this. She is just rotten to her core. I have no sympathy. 

I don’t want to kill or hurt her, but I want her to forever face the consequences for her actions. I want her every terrible decision to blow up in her face and keep her in prison. 

She is the only person I truly hate, because she is the only person who is horrible enough and that I know well enough to hate. || This is evolved thinking. Congratulations. || I’m a very logical person, and I’ve never really seen the purpose of hate. But it wasn’t until I met my ex-husband that I experienced a level of disdain I didn’t think was possible. I’ve never wished harm on someone more than I did him. I’m in a better place now, emotionally, but I still wouldn’t want to be anywhere near him.

Honestly, I believe a lot of his cruelty was learned. His father immigrated to America from Germany after the war, and I’ve always suspected he may have had ties to Nazi ideology. Whether or not that’s true, the abuse he inflicted clearly shaped who my ex became. I don’t like that man — he fundamentally changed how I see people.

Some people aren’t broken or misguided — they’re just not good. And that was a hard truth to accept. || I agree 100%. Although I can understand intellectually what can drive that. || You have a capacity for humanity that has depth. Thats a good thing. You can separate yourself from the actions of others. || unfortunately i am a hater for people who i deem to deserve it at my full potential lmao || I still feel this way and I'm 50. No one has crossed the line for me but there are some offenses that would make me delete someone from existence. || I’m the opposite, I can hate and delete people on a whim. Like they never existed in my life for one moment. It doesn’t even take that much to do that to someone.

I’ve realized people are expendable, easily replaced if needed. You just move and lie to new ones, you can manipulate yourself into most people’s lives without much effort.

It’s a kind of a ”call of the void” for me. Something I know I can do, but don’t (unless I’m very desperate). || i’m so sorry that you were hurt this bad:(. i really really hope it’ll all get better soon || I’m so so sorry you’re feeling this way:( || oh my gosh, i feel this way too!! i can indeed feel anger and disappointment, and even hate but.. i don’t even really know how to put my feelings into words. you seem like such a nice singling and i really hope your sister is now okay || same!!",1753730614.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbpom0/anybody_else_cant_hate_others_fully/,mentalhealth
Humor from a burnt out parent.,"Today my wife and I watched helplessly all day as our 2 year old dealt with a stomach bug. He threw up more times than we could count. So many times we had to give up on cleaning up and just let it all happen. Our swiffer has decided to retire and we have begun the process of ripping out our carpets and our sofa has now made it to the curb for anyone that dares. Went to the pediatrician with a towel over my last good shirt (today was laundry day, but our usual loads were on hold for obvious reasons). My son was retching out whatever was left in his stomach all over me and the towel as the receptionist conveniently decided to ask me for our insurance card bc she has her priorities straight. Our pediatrician prescribed nausea medication to keep things at bay (literally). The viral infection will pass but it won’t be easy. After taking the meds, diarrhea started. Our toddler has consistently been a difficult diaper changer, for about 6 months he’s hated getting his diaper changed. We have to usually do all sorts of theatrics to get him down on the changing pad. I’m talking curated playlist that takes Alexa 10 tries just to understand what the fuck we’re trying to get her to do, I’m talking change Elmo and Mickeys diapers first so they’re not left out, I’m talking get those Costco Disney royalty diapers. But today, no. Today was different. Today the diarrhea was so bad our son begged us to change his diaper. My wife had to go back to Costco in the middle of a diaper change bc we ran out of diapers and the pressure was so intense he had diarrhea shooting out uncontrollably he ruined the entire box of diapers. Now that he’s asleep, I’m surveying our house with a bottle of Resolve spray. It was quite the day. I’m certain at this point that God hates us.

How do I get Xanax/Ativan?,"Hello everyone,

I (22m) have had anxiety and panic attacks for as long as I can remember. I have a psychiatrist and medication prescribed to me for such things.

Involved In A Car Crash. Been Discharged From Several Different ER’s. Developed Intense Anxiety/Stress Over The Situation.,"I was involved in a car crash a little over two weeks ago and I wasn’t sure if I hit my head as I have no visible bruises, grazes, cuts or lumps and my head doesn’t really hurt. It all happened so quick as well so I’m just not 100% sure if I hit it or not. I went to the hospital and they discharged me after checking me and doing multiple neurological exams. They said it could possibly be a mild concussion and that it’d get better over time. The only symptoms I’ve had since the crash are mild headaches (don’t last long), dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue/drowsiness, hot/cold flashes and just a feeling of detachment. I just don’t feel like myself. It gets better when I go out and exercise and when I’m distracted by other things, but as soon as the thought of a serious head injury enters my brain again I start feeling worse. I’ve had really bad health anxiety in the past and I had gotten over it, but the crash has just triggered it again I think. I went to multiple hospitals - not just one. They all did neurological exams and said I have absolutely nothing to worry about, but still, I feel that something is wrong. I asked them for scans and they all said it was unnecessary because I was responding to the exams completely fine. Is this health anxiety or another anxiety/stress disorder?

Learning emotion regulation and facing emotions through digital detox,"Trying to detach from constant media consumption to face my emotions and learn how to regulate myself — but I’m scared of the silence

——

Hello everybody,

My therapist encouraged me to begin feeling and regulating my emotions instead of constantly distracting myself.

Right now, I realize I’m almost never alone with my thoughts. I’m always watching or listening to something — YouTube, Netflix, audiobooks, podcasts, TikTok, Instagram — whether I’m driving, shopping, walking, cooking, even eating. Silence makes me anxious. Not being distracted and not being able to flee from my own negative thoughts is unbearable.

I’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder, along with mild depression. I often spiral into negative thoughts, and I use media to escape those feelings. Today was rough — I felt off and couldn’t distract myself like usual. After a phone call with my dad, I broke down crying and felt really overwhelmed and sad, with negative and hopeless feelings about the future… but strangely, afterwards, I felt a little lighter. That moment made me realize: maybe I really do need to let these feelings in more often, really feel them in their full intensity, in order to let them pass.

My boyfriend actually went through something similar. He cut down drastically on media — no YouTube, no social media, only one episode of a show at night, and music only while driving. He told me he used to wake up with this “gross”, depressive feeling in the morning (same as I do), but ever since his changes, that feeling disappeared. He says he feels clearer and more emotionally stable now.

That gives me hope. But also… I’m scared. I’m genuinely afraid of what mornings will feel like without my usual breakfast-TV noise (I’ve watched morning shows for years). I don’t know what it’s like anymore to just exist without constant background noise. And while I could give up social media completely, which I’ve done before, the idea of facing the raw quiet of my own mind is still intimidating. I don’t know how to change my thinking patterns and see my life more positive.

Has anyone else gone through this kind of change? Does that awful morning feeling actually go away with less media input? What helped you ease into it — especially if you have anxiety or depression? How did you fill the time that you gained? How do you handle your emotions and regulate them?

I’d love to hear your stories, advice or even just reassurance that this is possible.",,1753787447.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc8kah/learning_emotion_regulation_and_facing_emotions/,mentalhealth
"🧠 I grew up in a broken home, and I'm tired of surviving in silence.","
I grew up in a dysfunctional family where my father prioritizes his own comfort over our basic survival. He spends money on ₹15,000 shoes, air conditioning for himself, and expensive medicines at the slightest discomfort — but when it comes to our school fees, food quality, or even my mother's medical treatment, he suddenly ""has no money.""

Our house is literally falling apart — roof leaks when it rains, we sleep on a 20-year-old mattress, clothes are kept in fruit baskets, and there's barely any proper furniture left.

I’ve never asked for luxuries — not even toys or gifts growing up — and yet I’ve always been treated like a burden.
Worse, when I try to speak up, society, relatives, and culture try to shut me down with “He’s your father, respect him.”

But what is there to respect when you’ve only ever been neglected, belittled, and emotionally starved?

I’m not writing this for sympathy.
I just want a place to speak, because I’ve been forced into silence for too long.
And if someone else out there feels this way too — you’re not alone.

Thanks for reading.","**Hello u/!**

Why is it easier to help others than to help yourself?,"Giving advice or supporting someone else feels natural. But when it’s time to take that same advice for yourself, it suddenly feels impossible. The double standard is frustrating, and I don’t really understand why it happens.","Because projecting control onto others is easier than admitting you have none over yourself. || I think it's because we don't see the timeframe we are on and don't recognize the progress we made. For me I have taking so many small steps it's hard to give advice from a place that isn't from firsthand experience. As far as it seeming impossible it could be because you're looking at the mountain rather than the first steps to get up the top or any of the steps you have taken. Another thing is mental health is not linear it's a process and it takes a lot of time for some people. || Someone conditioned you to suppress your own needs because it was easier for them, most likely || Thats definitely for me the case as well. I even take joy in helping others. For me its always nice when I manage to help someone and make them happy but when it comes to myself, I just completely shut down and either dont know what to do or I just dont even try to help myself. Im not sure why its like that though. || I relate to this so hard. || Idk how to reason that. Idk if there is a logical reason. But its just the way it is. When you are in the spot, there are so many emotions and thoughts to deal with yourself. Pressure, guilt, regret, fear and what not. And often its really hard to see the situation from a 3rd person perspective and take sensible action. Its hard to see the big picture with everything happening. 

But that's what we try to learn. We talk about our issues with others, not because they can give you the right advice. But because just by talking about it, you naturally tend to focus on what's actually happening with you. And hopefully helps you make the best decision that you can with all the knowledge you have at the time. 

Maybe another reason could be that we often know what to do. But its hard to make that decision and take action. Because we're scared of the consequences. So we sit wondering ""what if it doesn't work out the way it is in my head"". Taking the action requires understanding consequences, understanding anxiety. Or sometimes you just need to take the call despite the doubts because you realize that you'll never have answers to all your questions. You'll never have full clarity. 

If you ask me to flip a coin and say that I win if it's heads, I'll think about it for a second and then just flip it. But if you say I'll get hit by a car if its heads, then I'll sit and worry about it for longer. But what I need to understand is that I don't have a choice. The coin is just 50% probability. If I cant avoid the game, then I just take what i get. And everything in life is a probability. Nothing you do can make it 100% you can only change it to a certain extent. But on the flip side, nothing you do can also make it 0%. No matter what you do, there's always a small chance of everything working out. || Totally get this, it's so common. When you're helping someone else, you're not weighed down by their emotions, so things seem clearer. But when it's *your* life, fear, self-doubt, and emotions cloud everything. You're too close to it. It’s not a flaw, just human nature. Being aware of it is the first step to slowly breaking that double standard. || Because we humans are social creatures and we want to help as much as we can. || I was thinking about this today too! 

It is crazy that I am able to help other people. Listen and feel them even heal them, and God literally made me create my youtube channel to help others and spread the word. I did help others but lol when it ocmes to helping myself it's a roller coaster ! (my yt if you need help is nadiaminds)



But this is what i found : 

When it’s someone else, I can see the situation clearly. I’m not tangled up in their fear or shame or overthinking. I’m not carrying their past mistakes or self-doubt. I just see the next best step for them and I want to cheer them on.

But when it’s me? Oof. Suddenly everything feels blurry. The stakes feel higher. I question everything. The self-talk gets louder. It’s like trying to give advice while drowning in my own noise.

Helping myself means I have to face the things I avoid. It means holding myself with love—not just pushing through with pressure. And sometimes… I don’t feel like I *deserve* that help. Not really. Maybe I think others are worthy of support but I still hold back from offering that same grace to myself.

But here’s the truth I’m learning to sit with:  
Helping myself *is* helping others. Because when I’m clear, grounded, and strong—I show up better. I love deeper. I serve from a fuller cup.

So I’m trying something new:  
→ Giving myself the same kindness I give my friends.  
→ Not waiting to feel “worthy” of support.  
→ And remembering that clarity comes when I stop judging myself and start supporting myself. || Because we struggle to follow our own advice! || Because when you give others advice, you don't have to follow it yourself. || When we give advice, it is just moving air. When we have to follow advice, we have to exercise effort, often we need to confront our habits that must be changed, then it is too easy to decide that advice is wrong and follow familiar patterns. 

Only about 1-2% of all people I know are capable of changing things. 98% are forever stuck in their patterns and feel righteous. || That’s one of the cruel tricks of self-awareness, isn’t it? It’s so easy to see others clearly, to offer wisdom with love & certainty. But when it comes to ourselves, everything feels louder. Heavier. More tangled.

We can be someone else’s calm, but not our own. And I think it’s because advice is logic, but pain lives in emotion. And when it’s your pain, your fear, your shame..logic suddenly isn’t enough.

But the fact that you notice the double standard? That’s the first step toward breaking it imo. || - You may be second-guessing yourself  
- You may have already tried something to help yourself and it was ineffective, and you got discouraged  
- Your issues may be more complex than more simple tasks you help others with  
- You are sacrificing or deprioritizing your own wants and/or well-being || Our biology is wired that way. [One study shows that depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5895491/Neuralandbehavioralcorrelatesofnegativeself%E2%80%90focusedthoughtassociatedwithdepression-PMC) affects the brain more strongly in judgement centers among depressed people than non-depressed people. 

Our brain is more negative when faced with self assessment. And we are more able to be fair with outside perspectives. See others in a more neutral or favorable light. 

Why our brain develops that way can come from different places. But broadly speaking, it is a feedback and reinforcement loop. The more we repeat certain experiences the more it reinforces growth and development of certain patterns. || Saying is always easier than doing. In the case of others, we have to give just advice, nothing else. The person who is taking advice from us, just ask him how difficult to apply this.

In our case, it's not about help. When we are in a problem, you can see that we and our subconscious mind give too many advice and suggestions to us. But when it comes to how to apply it. Then it's a difficult task.

So it's not about others or about yourself. It's all about the quotes that "" Saying is always easier than doing."" || We can see each others shadows. Also saying one thing and actually doing it is another thing. Now I try to only give advice on something I’ve actually worked through. || Whewww!",1753705940.0,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbewvp/why_is_it_easier_to_help_others_than_to_help/,mentalhealth

It sounds like she has a history of mental health issues, and they were likely worsened by birth, possibly post partum psychosis. 

It's not your fault.

I'm guessing that you have custody of the baby for now while she's in treatment. That's where she needs to be. It's the best place for her.

She cannot be allowed to be abusive, end stop. 

She cannot be allowed to be abusive around her child, period. 

If she had that little control with you, it's likely that she will abuse the child. At bare minimum, you have a duty to the baby to make sure that can't happen. 

Hopefully, she will respond to treatment, and also be willing to go into therapy. She's not fit too be a mom right now. 

Hugs to you, and the baby. || I’m really sorry you’re dealing with this, it sounds incredibly tough. You’ve done your best to support her, but her mental health has reached a point where it’s not safe for anyone, including your child.

This isn’t your fault, even if she blames you. Her mind is in a very dark place, and you can’t fix it alone. Keep protecting your child, lean on professionals, and take care of yourself too. You’re not giving up, you’re doing what’s necessary. || That's rough, but she needs to address her mental issues and nothing is really going to work until she does. I can tell you from experience, that they can blame you till the end of time, and all that will happen is you'll get tired of it. 

Even if you do want to stay with her, you're not going to do her any good unless your mental stability is on point. Maybe you should get therapy too. || Post partum psychosis is real and terrifying. I hope she gets the treatment she needs, and I hope you have some support to help you and your child. This is horrible, I am really sorry. ||

What should I do about this?,"there’s times where I feel good and don’t think anything is wrong with me and then other times I feel really awful to the point of it being really debilitating.

I have a psychiatrist, but almost none of the medication they are prescribing me are really helpful. However, that’s mostly my fault because I don’t really give enough info about my problems because i’m afraid of the chance of being sent to the ward or not being believed at all. 

When I do give out some details, I feel a bit dismissed and my sessions usually end in about 5 minutes, but it’s probably a misunderstanding on my part and I just need to  learn how to carefully communicate about it more. 

I don’t know what I should properly say to my psychiatrist without looking crazy or how to prevent the constant cycling back and forth into depression. 

I would appreciate some advice. Thanks.

Does anybody want to be my friend?,Hello. I am a 29m. I don’t really know what’s wrong with me. I’m crazy though. Mood swings and stuff. Paranoid. Really negative and depressed. Hard to be around people. I dont have any friends or family to talk to. Nobody sticks around once they realise im not normal. My family literally said nobody wants me around. Im having cognitive decline I think partly cus im so lonely and depressed. My memory is getting bad. I used to be really outgoing and have lots of friends. Ive been traveling around to remote areas for years now to isolate though. I have a beautiful dog and we go on lots of adventures together but I just feel so empty. I feel like I have no reason to keep on suffering. I miss people. I miss hearing a friendly voice. Does anybody want to talk or maybe play Xbox or something? ,"yeah text me || thanks for sharing that it takes real courage. You’re not crazy or broken, just overwhelmed and hurting. Anyone would feel lost being so isolated for so long.
You matter, and your pain is real. Even if it feels like nobody cares, I do and there are people out there who would want to talk, listen, or even just play Xbox and chill with you. You’re not alone.

I’m Literally Almost Done,"Why are some mods so rude?! (Not talking about the mods here btw) I just wanted to help by nOoO I get banned! I JUST WANT TO HELP

Ok while that’s out of the way, I’m almost done. I’m angry and upset. I don’t know what to do! I want to help myself but there’s this wall that’s stopping me. 

Why is my life so complicated?! I have a nice family if you’re interested in Fox News and being conservative. I used to be but now I’m not. I’m genderfluid, bi, and proud of it.

I can’t tell them ANYTHING about it how I feel or I’ll get yelled at. My own grandmother can’t even accept my OCD diagnosis. Lord knows how she’ll act to an autism diagnosis. 

I CANT COMMUNICATE RIGHT! I DONT UNDERSTAND PEOPLE AND NEVER WILL. I have special needs that absolutely fucking no one has ever met. I need help. I feel like I’m falling apart. I just want to help people. I want this mask off but if I do that, I’ll put myself in danger. I’m so sensitive to what anybody says…

I don’t feel right,"
It feels like no one every knows what I’m talking about. It feels like every response I give to people feels like it wasn’t supposed to be said the way I said it. Every time. No matter what it is. Every conversation I have in my head to myself feels that way too. I don’t know why I feel like that. I know I’m being too critical and judgy of myself but I can’t help but feel like I’m always doing something wrong. All my words feel awkward, too drawn out, not drawn out enough, not knowledgeable enough, even down to the pitch of my voice not being right. 


It’s a gnawing feeling of isolation only I know and feel and apparently everyone around me doesn’t think of my so critically. Even when I’m near people I feel like I’m not in the room. Daydreaming or not- which I definitely do- I just sit there and feel like a huge bug in the room. I’m always in my own world. My whole life. I didn’t say much in school. I was shy, upset over every little thing, never felt interesting enough for someone to genuinely care for me. I had a lot of trash friends and friends that had me as a backup friend. Ive struggled with the idea of me really enjoying being alone, or always longing for friends. Maybe I’ve been tired of people that I don’t feel like can understand me. 

I constantly look in the mirror and study my face. I get very worked up over my appearance. In school I would obsessively go to the bathroom just to check on how I look. Everyday, multiple times a day, it was so much and I’m teenage girls are insecure but I was unhealthily obsessed and I still am. I always hate saying that I feel different because what does that even mean? Everyone is at least somewhat different from everyone else. I just feel like an awkward, ugly, alien that isn’t supposed to be here. And I don’t feel “special” I don’t want people to think I see myself that way, that’s also something I worry about.

im 80% sure i have bpd and i feel so fucking stuck,"words cant even describe how i feel right now im bawling my eyes out typing this and i dont want to be cringey but i feel so fucking angry at everything. i know bpd can be inherited from parents, my dad has never been diagnosed with it but i KNOW he has it. i know. his relationship with my mom is terrible she wants to leave him but he wont let her. he will do anything to stop her from leaving. hes so paranoid shes cheating on him when shes not, hes installed cameras in her bedroom, doesnt let her go out with friends, threatens to get me and my siblings taken away from her if she leaves, so much shit. he has addiction problems with EVERYTHING. hes an ex meth addict, he gambles our money away, pretty much gets his hands on anything he can to make him feel different. and i see myself in my dad so fucking much. im 15, idk if theres an age limit for this subreddit, and so many people i talk to about this with either say, ""you cant have bpd at 15"" or ""its just teenage hormones"" and it feels so invalidating because i KNOW how i feel. ive been begging my mom to help me get a psychiatrist for years but she shoves it off because she doesnt see mental health as an important subject but i cant blame her because of how she was raised. ive dealt with my parents fighting my whole life and its deeply affected me and i dont want my little siblings to deal with it either. ive mentioned to my dad saying he probably has bpd but he gets so angry when i mention it so i stopped trying. ive took my moms zoloft to try and help me bc i cant get fucking help and it doesnt work. i have extreme jealousy when it comes to my boyfriend and its ruining our relationship. im so mean to the people im closest with. one simple comment is enough for me to completely lash out on him and not talk to him for days. the littlest things send me over the edge. i smoke weed to help but i got caught smoking at school so i have a court date which means ill be drug tested. so i cant do that anymore and its making me even worse ive resorted to cutting myself just to have something to do in my free time. i know it sounds weird. i just want to feel heard right now i dont know what to do. i feel like im going insane right now.","i just need someone to talk to. im gonna try and bring this up to my mom again tomorrow, its been a while since i have but i hope she lets me see a psychiatrist or something. i dont know if this is weird to say, but i just want her to care its almost like i want to be babied. i just want a ""its okay sweetheart, mommy will help you"" type of situation. i hope thats not weird. i also didnt include a lot of details because its hard to fit it all in a post no ones gonna fucking read anyways || Oh god I ache for you.. || I hear you 100%. I am so sorry about everything you are going through and I wish I could do everything to help you. I would say communicate this with your boyfriend. Tell him what you think you have and make sure he takes the conversation seriously. Aside from that, i can’t believe you have to go to court for smoking weed at school, ugh, that is actually such a stupid process. Growing up in a toxic household with parents who have most likely passed down their mental health issues to you definitely does not make it easier, but does your school have any counseling they can do? Is anyone else aware of your life at home? I feel like having at least some other friend or family you can go to talk to will be so helpful, especially if they know you and your family like that. This was so brave of you to talk about, you deserve so much better. I promise you, it will be okay in the end. You should try and see if you can reach out to a psychologist through your school or really try to get a therapist from your mom. You don’t even have to make it about mental health, therapy benefits everyone! Your mom should understand, and I’m sorry that she doesn’t. I think you should bring up how she wasn’t raised in a time like you or in an environment like you, that you’re under a lot more stress from school, maybe even bring up how you had to use weed to cope because you can’t get therapy!! (This is the reason in my situation at least). Those are definitely some factors that can help back you up and suggest to your mom that therapy could be a good thing for you. || i forgot to mention in this post that its not just family issues that makes me this way i was also bullied so much in middle school to the point i went homeschooled and isolated myself in my room for almost two years with no friends i was so lonely. im doing okay schoolwise now though, i have some friends, still not really any close close ones but yea idk i just felt like i should mention that. || :// thank u so much for actually reading that it means a lot || i wanna talk to my boyfriend about it but i feel like anytime i talk to someone about how i feel, my mind goes blank. like suddenly i dont know how i feel anymore and im afraid itll be like that if i do see a therapist. ive talked to school councilors about anxiety and simple stuff like that but i dont want to go any further because ive heard horror stories about people getting taken away. my family is a bit dysfunctional but i love them regardless with my whole heart and i would honestly kms if that ever happens to me i love them to death its my biggest fear. and i do have an older brother who moved out who knows exactly how my family is. he actually went through the exact same shit i did, the whole drug court process and he got sent away to some replacement home for a year. its actually scary how similar we are. we used to be so close before he moved out but we maybe talk like once every three to four months now. at the time when he was sent away he was diagnosed with multiple things, adhd, schizophrenia and when he was rlly rlly young he was diagnosed with aspergers (idk if any of that is relevant) but yeah. i could talk to him, i have before about this, he said he would help me and talk with my mom but i honestly think he forgot. i dont wanna reach out bc it seems like i only reach out when i need help but thats far from the truth, i miss him so much and wish he would visit more :/ sorry for the long paragraph || Never be sorry for the long paragraphs! I really appreciate you telling me more. Honestly i completely understand when your mind just goes blank when you want to talk about how you feel. Thats how i felt at my first therapy session. The thing is, your therapist is gonna be the one asking a lot of questions about you on the first day. I warmed up really quickly to my therapist because she learned a lot about me and when i answered questions i just just kept saying more about myself and honestly like it really is easy to talk to a GOOD therapist. Also, i think your brother is a great resource. I think he would be glad to help you. You should never feel ashamed reaching out for help because maybe he genuinely did forget. You should tell him that you need his help and that you miss him because having at least that one family member who understands you is huge. You should rebuild a relationship with your brother!",1753763683.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc270v/im_80_sure_i_have_bpd_and_i_feel_so_fucking_stuck/,mentalhealth

Worried about getting on anti-depressants,"I have been in therapy for about 6 months now. My therapist is highly mindfulness focused, and so far I’ve had one breakthrough, but a traumatic event  caused me to relapse back into my cycle of mild-medium depression (which I’ve had for about 5 years now).

My whole life, my family has been anti-medication. My therapist isn’t, but wanted to tackle my depression and anxiety with therapeutic intervention first. I also feel that I sometimes don’t inform him of just how depressed I feel on a daily basis, as we try to focus on what I can do to better myself, positivity and goals.

I worry about how getting on anti-depressants will affect my life, my body and being considered a medicated person and all the stigma that comes with it. I also worry about how medical professionals seem to overly-prescribe meds and about becoming dependent on them and therapy to function.

However, my s/o and I have come to a conclusion that my lack of progress in therapy may be assisted with anti-depressants. 

Does anyone have advice for me? Especially if you have experience with medication or are in the field and can inform me better on actual medical interventions.

For context, I have PDD(Dysthemia) and severe-medium anxiety symptoms. I’ve also considered getting tested for ADHD/Autism.

Thanks, all love 🤙

EDIT: I’m from the US","First off ignore the stigma of antidepressants. The stigma only exists if you let it. The truth is that depression is a medical condition and medicine can help. 

Side effects of antidepressants can be challenging, but that’s something you gotta talk to the doctor about. Almost all of them cause dry mouth for the first few weeks and they can make your stomach feel icky. You get used to that though, and you can lessen it if you take meds with food. 

The teal kicker is the sexual side effects, ie no t being able to *finish*. That was rough for me, enough that I was more willing to go back to my depressed state. I talked to my doctor and we switched medications. Side effects gone and I’m feeling much better now. 

Don’t let anyone tell you they don’t believe in medicine for depression. It’s just like saying they don’t believe in medicine for a cold or any other illness. Consult a doctor, and leave your family’s anti-medicine feelings behind. || Why should there be stigma regarding medication? If you have a headache, you pop a painkiller. If you have cold, you get some cold meds. If you have a condition, it’s okay to have a treatment for it. We live in an era of medical technology for a reason. No one should have to suffer if they have the means to help it. You can be scared of side effects, but you can also be hopeful to find relief. What would you rather feel? Usually the breaking point for when people finally consider taking medication is when they can no longer deal with feeling unwell - the point of desperation. You have the means to prevent yourself from reaching that point. Medication is meant to help you. Take it with the thought it’s meant for relief. ",1753770197.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc41en/worried_about_getting_on_antidepressants/,mentalhealth
"recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, how do i tell my family?","I (41M) have recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, im ashamed to admit that I’ve definitely put my family through hardship and probably ruined my marriage and my relationship with my kids.

I feel liminal like a ghost,"I'm just a stranger on the internet and a stranger to everyone else I meet.

My true self is hidden, even from myself. This is because I feel unsafe. I live with my mother, father, and a younger sibling.

When I was 2, I saw my father's family member point a knife threateningly to my mom from a window of the bedroom I was locked in with my cousin.

I've always seen my father beat my mother up until about 2018, and my father would also discipline me. I was close to my mother and when she became the breadwinner in 2009, I told her that we don't bond anymore and that all she does is snap at me. Around this time, she also started to ALSO be aggressive towards me more than my father. I just have to be well behaved and my father won't hit me. She would fix my hair and yank it, would pinch me and slap me. When I was seven, she began to full out beat me up.

My father stopped beating me when I was like 10, and now im 20, im still getting beat up. Things that my mother did that bothers me a lot are:

* did an exorcism on me by herself after beating me up and scolding me
* calls me a narcissist
* threatens to ""remind"" me that im the problem(there was a five month period where I was beaten up daily.)
* everything I am is because of her. my education, my looks, my taste, my intelligence
* violates privacy and observes me--location is accessed, all accounts are visible to her, what im doing should be approved first, no longer than half an hour in the bathroom and no phones either
* you sleep when told to
* public humiliation
* mockery like a child(her being a child)
* looks at my stretch marks and celliulites in disgust when im changing where she can see me
* im not allowed to go to malls for fun or just walk outside
* my schedule is made and observed by her
* my own achievements by my own initiatives are ignored but my own achievement for something she told me to do is because of her.

I don't have friends because my mom's logic is that if they dont meet my criteria(basically putting me first AND also obeying my mom), they arent my true friends. If I do find friends, she disapproves of them because misery loves company and I'm probably plastic with them or they are also rotten like me if they tolerate my ""attitude""

I have also concluded that I receive punishment because when she doesnt get her way, someone must be the problem and cause.",,1753783168.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc7cv3/i_feel_liminal_like_a_ghost/,mentalhealth
"no motivations, stuck in the same loop for 5 years now","i dropped out in like 2020 and since then i’ve just been in the same loop of doing whatever for the last 5 years, playing games, messing with my phone, whatever. it’s very pathetic and i regret dropping out, im seeing everyone i went to school with go to college and making something of themselves while im just pretty much the same as i was when i was in HS, only difference is that mentally im doing worse. 

i’ve tried doing my ged, but even with that im stuck in a loop. been studying ONLY the language arts test for 3 years now on and off. at one point i felt i was more than ready to do it 2 years ago, but i slipped and went back into doing nothing. i feel so pathetic and like a waste. i have family that never finished high school that now struggle with money in their 40s and i really dont want to be like them, but even that isnt enough to get me motivated on the right path. i try my best to be disciplined, but when i do ever get steady on that i always slip off like 2 weeks later. im losing all hope for myself and starting to feel like everything i’ve done, which isnt much, is all worthless. 

i dont know what exactly i’m looking for in posting this, i dont think anyone here can really give advice since im just some random, but i just needed to let it out somehow. i had so many plans this year and its already more than halfway over and i havent accomplished a single thing. sure i OCCASIONALLY exercise and whatever but thats about it thats new for me this year. everything else is just the same old for the past 5 years. i dont want to waste my life away and waste all my 20s doing nothing. i’m almost 22 and i have nothing to show for it. 

another thing, i’ve had people ask me what i like to do and what my hobbies are but i can’t even answer that honestly, the things i do is just being lazy and i don’t think qualify as actual hobbies, and even if they were, i no longer find enjoyment in them anyways. everything just feels so meaningless now. i feel that even though i started my studying again it won’t amount to a single thing. no matter how hard i try

","Have you looked into aspects or personality traits that are perhaps hindering your potentials?

Like maybe adhd or a form of it? Do you feel more alive if you are busy with a couple of things going on at the same time but useless at focusing on one thing alone?

Have you looked into your personality type?

Are you very sensitive to the world around you.. And see things different from others like most things are meaningless to you whilst to others are exceptional? (or the other way around). 

Do you feel like people don't really understand who you are or perhaps feel misunderstood most times?

I don't have answers to your questions... Just more questions to trigger some sort realization that might unlock whatever is that keeps you stuck and in a loop. 

I know the feeling. || You're asking for help in a mental health sub so I'm going to suggest therapy to start. You need to start talking some stuff out and I think you see that yourself or you wouldn't have made this post. You are reaching out for help. You're right that you are a random person but that doesn't mean we can't give advice. The key though is whether or not you will take the steps necessary to get out of the cycle you seem to be stuck in. We are our own worst enemy but we can also be our best advocates. It doesn't happen overnight but step by step. I don't know if you believe in God or not but if you do I suggest praying and asking for clear answers and asking for doors to be opened for you. But again the key is you have to walk through those doors. You have to take the steps. We can't take the steps for you. It took me many years to get help for my mental health so when I did start taking the steps I have been my best advocate since. It didn't happen quickly though. It is a process that you have to be willing to go through just like staying the course for your GED. Only you can shake yourself free from this cycle and it sounds like you are ready. I say go for it. One step, one day at a time. You can do this. You can be what you want to be. Picture yourself where you want to go and just go. There is help and resources available.

i think a lot about my past relations,"i dont know what to call it. i think a lot about my past partners i have 2. it’s not like i fantasize about them, but i think about it every single day like almost every second of the day. so basically it’s consumed my whole life. i don’t think its regret but i do get kinda upset about it bc my 2nd partner was kinda a one night stand. my 1st was a situation ship. i want to basically recycle my bodies bc i feel kinda used in sense. like im less valuable than i was before since im at 2 bodies and i haven’t been in a relationship before. it’s something i can’t really put my finger on. i hate that this consumes me on my day to day life. i don’t regret any of my past with these men but i just think about it wayyyy to often. my friend tells me that the next guy i get with i should be in a committed relationship bc this situation echos loudly through my brain. ik that if these 2 guys ask to have sex again i would probably say yes. had this happened to anyone less?","are you Christian by any chance || alternatively, are you like 17/18 y.o?",1753767346.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc39m6/i_think_a_lot_about_my_past_relations/,mentalhealth
Struggling with life,"I’m in my mid-20s, working a job in a city away from my family and live alone. I feel like I’ve become overly dependent on people who helped me recently — like a friend who let me stay at her place for a few days. I also get emotionally affected if someone doesn’t respond the way I expect, and that makes me retreat more.

I’m also preparing for exam and some days I have energy… other days I can’t focus or even eat properly. I walk a lot just to cope. Weekends feel especially lonely. And lately, I’ve been feeling like there’s no one to really lean on — people have their own lives, and I don’t want to burden them.

Everyone around me seems to be moving ahead — in careers, relationships — and I feel stuck in this job with no growth. I overthink every decision, even though it’s just money or logistics.

If anyone else has been through this phase — where life feels directionless, and you’re emotionally overwhelmed by even simple changes — how did you cope or make it through?

How to accept the life I got?,"I [M31] am someone who always had big dreams. I was only a child when I had my dreams so clear what I am going to do, what I am going to be in my life, how will be my life.

But nothing happened as I wanted, dreamed or hoped. I got a life that I never ever thought I am going to live like this. I always expected that ‘you can’t know and life has its way’ but I never thought of THIS.

So for years I am having so much sadness, can’t accept the life I got, that no matter how much I tried, no matter what lengths I went, no matter how much I gave, I never got what I wanted or deserved.

All that made me to get isolated, I get out of the house at most once in three-four months (for real), and this for years now, get into depression and sadness is all I feel!
I am having social anxiety, I have anxiety in general, compulsive thoughts got worse… but still I am refusing to get up. I accepted my reality and I just wish and pray to not wake up, and everyday I get so sad when I open my eyes and is another day, that for me feels just like Groundhog Day, a loop into infinity, living a life I don’t like and I don’t want, being forced to do it again and again and again…

The only thing that brings me peace is knowing that soon it would be all over || Please don’t kill yourself. Not only because it is the most selfish thing you can do and is killing someone your family and friends love, but because I guarantee there is so much left you haven’t discovered in life.

Jesus loves you, and please tell someone in your life what’s going on❤️ || Yes but when you have a win in life you feel so happy you didn’t do it || Hey you might be masocistic 

But please dont do it || Oh my god, DON’T.

I’m 17 but I’d say I’m beyond mature for my age. I’ve always been very good at hiding my problems mentally but it has always backfired on me. I’ve pushed away people who were only trying to help. And the times I do open myself up, I’d have no idea if they were serious or not and the moment I said the wrong line, the people abandoned me.

Life is never over until you actually do end it and I’ve came too far to do that now and you shouldn’t either if you are think about that.

What made me realize it can get better is that if I ended it now, I would’ve never seen how much better my life would’ve been. I know people would miss me if I died and my potential can be used for something greater or at least have a much more pleasant life afterwards. You need to find a silver lining in everything. Be greater for what you have and maybe try to be resourceful because there’s always help when you need it. You’re not alone. || this was me 6 months ago when i losed hope when i failed in an exam i tried to sucide 3 attempts but still survived i guess someone didnt want to sucide?? maybe (when i did that i was 14M now im 15M) || youre 17. I dont think you fully comprehend what youre actually thinking about. ill be honest, im in my mid 20s and so are all my friends, we all have shitty lives, enlisted, deployed, blah blah, but to be honest its not that bad, just something to complain about when we're bored, my point is, ur life doesn't sound that bad, I doubt it is, feeling ""happy"" about being dead is either complete bullshit to get some attention, or you should tell ur mom n dad or whatever abt it. I understand that reddit is literally right on ur phone, but theres also DOZENS of actually helpful, qualified, and free resources out there for ur mental health. so yeah. || Okay, I'm not saying they have the right solution, but what would you say to this person when it doesn't get better? I mean I've been suffering from these thoughts since I was 13. Now 23 and have only WORSENED since. You can find many other people who feel similar. It doesn't always get better and this advice doesn't always help. || That's just depression everyone goes through depression. But when your life is literally not worth living like not just slightly sad but you literally have 0 reasons to be alive it actually doesent get better 🤣 I've been suicidal since I was 14 and I'm now 23 and still suicidal I have been to therapy I have been to all differant kinds of help and nothing works I hate my life because my penis is small and there's nothing me or anyone can do about it I feel the exact same as OP on a daily basis. When your depressed you get over it eventually when your suicidal because your life is not worth living it does not go away it grows into a bigger and bigger problem until you kill yourself. || Oh damn. I considered it after failing an exam but I stopped right before I was gonna do it, I just told myself “man ur parents still gonna be disappointed in you even if ur dead they can log onto your school account to get the exam results” 😭 || saying stuff like this is probably not the best thing to say, your a real piece of shit || There is a way, to understand why you're here alive, the reasons you find living for aren't the same reasons you've been given to explore. Not everyone experience depression, most people don't, they do know what internal struggle means but do you see everyone outside completely devoid of life, wearing slobby clothes, unclean and mentally unhinged. Thoughts bother everyone and everyone's brain can exercise thoughts to gain heightened emotion its not common to turn into obsessions. I've asked people who have no trouble with life what they think depression means and most of the time it's wrong, youd be able to get a little pique of acknowledgement of depression from people who appear weird or are disconnected from others.

Your depression can heal and become better but it can't be taken out like a virus. Metaphor virus fits because we can fight being sick but it can't be gotten rid of. People arent able to feel one emotion through out their lifes, depression will stabilise and turn into something different or worse, if it keeps getting worse it means your mind hasn't touched up some corners to understand what's happening with you, we can learn little from what we see around this planet because its all under one expedition by one person, but we can learn much from ourselvs and the sooner you get worse the closer you get to get better. People don't say their life's get better because they don't value the good in their life's before feeling bad, if you want to give less value to your problems and issues you need to reconstruct them in your brain and look at your problems again, change what gives your problems fuel and energy.",1753716024.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbj237/i_get_so_happy_thinking_about_ending_myself/,mentalhealth
"First therapy appointment, terrified","Hey, so I just scheduled my first counseling appointment. I’ve been struggling with my mental health from a young age, but have always just dealt with it alone. Regretfully that resulted in ghosting anyone who started to catch on or ask questions, and a lot of anxiety around convincing my family nothing is wrong.

I’ve always wanted to go to therapy but dreaded needing to talk to my parents. Any sort of vulnerability makes me physically uncomfortable and I get the strong urge to flee. However now I’m an adult so I can just take myself.

Yet now that therapy is so close, I’m feeling extremely anxious. My mental health has gotten so bad I want to take a semester off college. I know I can’t survive another semester and I need to heal outside of the academic pressure and anxiety. However I need to get approved from the school for a semester off so I won’t lose my scholarship.

Any written documentation from a professional would really help. So I’ve finally decided to try counseling at my school. This is something I’ve always wanted but I guess it took reaching my breaking point to force my hand. 

However I just feel sick about it. I’m absolutely terrified they therapist is going to insinuate I’m just being dramatic and that I only want a semester off because I’m lazy. Or they’ll think I’m lying to get approval. I’m worried they’re going to do what my parents do, just nod and brush everything off as normal, not a cause for concern, and that I just need to tough it out. The idea of hearing that from a therapist makes me want to vomit. The shame would be unbearable.

The possibility upsets me so much it’s all I can think about. If a therapist tells me I’m just exaggerating and I’m choosing to be this way, I’ll know my entire life I’ve just been pathetic and selfish and I wasted years being miserable and I could have just chose to be happy. And I’m really just a self-absorbed attention-seeker.

I know I’m very sensitive, I suspect I’m a highly sensitive person (HSP) or have rejection sensitive dysphoria. I have never been able to cope with criticism all my life, it causes intense, overwhelming shame. I was the kid to cry if a teacher got even mildly upset with me.

Does anyone have any advice or can share their experience? How did your first appointment go, were you taken seriously?","I understand that you're feeling anxious. But you don't need to overcome that anxiety before starting therapy. In fact, your anxiety can be part of what you bring into the first session. You could simply start by saying exactly what you've written here. You don’t need to have it all figured out in advance. You’re not supposed to face this alone, the therapist isn’t there to judge you like a strict teacher, but to help you, even with your fear of going to therapy itself. Print your post and take it with you on your first appointment. || When I finally went I was nervous just the same. The therapist did take me serious. I actually started with a therapist at the school I was attending at the time. 

I took my advantage of my free sessions then found therapy from an actual office. 

Therapy takes time and patience. You have to be honest with them and yourself. They’re not there to judge you. Sometimes their answers may be hard to hear but may very well be needed. 

You may also not like the therapist because of their style of therapy, so if that’s the case, don’t give up and instead find a new therapist.

Being short is the worst curse I could have received,"The insecurity is sort of on and off because most of the rude (though sometimes not purposely rude) comments about short men are online and I tend to try to ignore them as it’s not always the same as real life. There are many times where I am content with my height but I have realized that I have almost never been taken seriously about anything because of my height by anyone other than some of my friends.

I keep hearing about 5’7 being considered short while I am 5’2-3ish and over half way through high school. Sure, I still have a few more inches to grow, but I have never been a tall kid nor a fast grower (neither of my parents are tall either so it’s obviously a genetic thing). The majority of my friends are around or in the 6ft range and I feel left out and have trouble fitting in around them every time we hang out, especially because I always find myself behind them as if they completely forgot about me. There have also been so many instances where they literally don’t see me for a few moments when I am right beside or Infront of them.

This next issue is probably a stretch, but I have almost never heard of a girl that would take a short guy over a tall guy even if the tall guy is worse in some way. To be clear, I’m not trying to generalize any women to this stereotype or make any misogynistic remarks. Most of it I have heard online (which as I said, I don’t always take seriously) and I really haven’t gone out of my way to connect with that many girls so I am definitely not an expert at knowing what they like which is why I claim this as a stretch. Obviously I’m not saying there is anything wrong with a woman wanting a tall man over a short man. Preferences are perfectly fine and I would never be upset towards anyone for having any, I am just upset at the belief that the majority of guys will be a better choice compared to me due to their height. 

One last issue which is 100% the worst, is how often I am mistaken to be a girl simply because I am short and not muscular. Some of my friends don’t even seen to notice how insulting it is. For example, I went to a friends house during lunch break and when he went Inside his house and came back out, he tells me how his mom commented on how he was hanging out with a girl. The “girl” in question was me. Craziest part is that I went there again during another lunch break and he went inside and came back out again and guess what? This time his dad mistook me for a girl too. I find the fact that both times he had to mention it to me and laugh about it was super disrespectful. There have been countless other times where I have been mistaken for a girl this year alone but I see no reason to mention all of them.

I just felt like posting this as I have never really talked about it to anyone and the fact that I cannot change my height is really bothering me, especially with the standards I have heard of. It doesn’t bother me most of the time but whenever it does, it really affects my mental health.

Also sorry for any poor grammar. It’s midnight and I really don’t feel like re-reading this for the 3rd time 😭",,1753779230.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc6cbl/being_short_is_the_worst_curse_i_could_have/,mentalhealth
My friend's girlfriend has been cheating on him for a year and he doesn't want to believe it,"Greetings to those reading. Before I begin, I will tell you in advance that the text will contain changed names to avoid loss of anonymity. 

I don't even know where to start first. Recently, rumors have started to appear in my social circle that my close friend's girlfriend is cheating on him with her ex. I am a person who tries not to believe in rumors floating among the Russian-speaking community (which is actually not very big), and not to continue spreading them without a good reason for me or evidence (photos, video, voice in extreme case). But this time the rumors started about my friend. 

Just a couple of days ago, sitting in a hookah bar I got a call from a mutual friend of ours, and asked me to urgently go into a group call, as the situation concerns my friend. Without suspecting anything, I go into this group call, where they start asking me questions, like (if you know he's being cheated on, why don't you tell him directly? I had to explain to the guys that I don't support this bullshit with rumors and other nonsense without solid evidence. They suggested that I call her ex and find out how it really was, as if he wanted to tell me everything because of the recent disagreement. I agreed. After fifteen minutes of conversation in my gallery I had several screenshots of correspondence between the girl and her ex, where she drunkenly begs him to come to her house and one photo of a racy nature. After a bit of thinking, I call my friend and ask: ""Buddy, is your girlfriend with you? He says he's lying next to him right now. I had to ask him to move away and to open a telegram, where I had already sent everything I had. I had to ask him to step back and send a telegram, where I had already sent everything I had. 

A few hours later, I tried to contact him to see what they had decided. Turns out my friend didn't want to believe what I texted him. At least in that correspondence. I didn't understand, but I decided to ask about the picture, and he told me that he forgave her and decided he could live with it. For what it's worth, I thought he was just afraid of losing her and that she wouldn't do it again.

It would seem that everything, we can finish the story. It would seem that everyone is happy, the friend has decided everything for himself and nothing else will change. But not in this case. I ran into this ex-boyfriend while grocery shopping today. We had a few words, and he asked, ""So what did your friend decide in the end?

I had to tell him that I hadn't made up my mind, that I'd left it at that. The guy's eyes popped out. And at that exact moment, he told me all the times she cheated on him. Not only did it start a year ago, it fucking lasted until the acquaintances mentioned in the beginning called. He showed me some more videos and pictures of them spending time together while she said she was sitting with her friends and no guys were with them. 

And eventually, I texted my friend again. Said I couldn't just forget what I'd learned today. Tomorrow morning he and his girlfriend are going to the sea in another part of the country. We agreed to go to a bar with him after his return and now I want to ask for reddit's opinion. What should I do in this situation? Should I leave things as they are and wait for her to break his heart or should I tell him the truth?

Ask any questions in the comments, I will try to answer them immediately. ","Rereading this text, I apologize for some Russian slang, if you did not understand something, please clarify, I will try to explain. || i think its worth telling him, probably not until after he returns from the trip though. knowing he has a trip with her coming up is probably fueling his motivation to “push through” this. this is a shitty situation to be in i’m sorry. if you tell him and he truly chooses not to believe you, i guess you cant push further. just be a supportive friend when she does inevitably break his heart instead of “i told you so” denial is a hell of a drug i wish you luck || I don't know, man, only you can make that decision. It's your personal business, and you know your friend better than we do. But if we're talking in a vacuum, I would, of course, tell him everything in detail and explain how much he's deceiving himself and how destructive it will be for him, but it's up to him to accept this information or turn a blind eye. In that case, you've already sown enough seeds of doubt. The first stage of acceptance is denial, and it's quite difficult to go through it, but you'll have to. I also use a lot of Russian slang here, ahaha, anyway, good luck. || I'm pretty much lining up with u/l0stmyjuul on this one, he said what I had in mind ngl and I again wanted to mention that if your friend still does not want to see the facts and to somehow accept it after being shown every bit of proof and context about the cheating, then you have to know something important, you cannot save someone that does not want to be saved, at all imo || Thank you, I will take your advice. I forgot to mention that I told him we would need to talk about it, but I didn't go into details. || Yeah if he doesn't want to believe it with proofs under his eyes then it's his choice, you cannot save someone that does not want to be saved || I will remember your comment when I talk to him. || its a hard burden to bear for sure. idk if my advice is the best, but it is the best i can think of & probably how i would go about this. maybe in person if possible, so she is not there to sway him. im sure you’re already planning on it, but explain to him that you ran into her ex, so he knows you didnt get this information maliciously or keep pushing once he decided to stay..  the guy hes been cheated on with is practically rooting for him to leave!",1753743781.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbv9qu/my_friends_girlfriend_has_been_cheating_on_him/,mentalhealth
Struggling with Anxiety? Here's What Helped Me Cope (And Might Help You Too),"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to open up a little about my journey with anxiety and maybe share something that could help someone else too.

For the longest time, I thought anxiety was just part of who I am. The racing thoughts, tight chest, constant overthinking—it was exhausting. 😔 But the moment I accepted that *mental health is health*, things started to shift.

I still have anxious days (don’t we all?), but here are a few things that have genuinely helped me manage it better:

* **Box breathing** (inhale 4 secs, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) – calms me down quickly
* **Journaling** – I write down my worries instead of letting them spin in my head
* **Limiting caffeine** – game changer for me
* **Digital detox** – even 30 mins off screens helps me reset
* **Talking to someone** – whether it’s a friend, therapist, or a community like this ❤️

Most importantly, I’ve learned to **not feel guilty for resting**. Anxiety isn’t laziness or weakness. It’s a sign your mind needs care and patience.

If you’re reading this and struggling, you’re not alone. You're doing your best—and that’s enough. One day, one breath at a time. 🌱

Would love to hear what’s helped you too. Let’s support each other 💬👇

Ready to give up :(,"I always said I’d never be the type who would actually consider doing it, but now I often think about how things would be without me. My empty room. I wonder if my mom would sleep in my bed for a bit. I wonder if they would leave everything here untouched. It would be so empty and cold in here. I’m just so tired of everything. Feels like I have nothing going for me. I know it could always be worse but man it’s pretty bad.. I’ve done nothing but make the wrong choices in my life. I legit have nothing going for me and I’m 25 lol. I went to school for 4 years for a degree that doesn’t even help. I finished a year ago and can’t even land any interviews let alone a job. Nobody wants to help me, everyone who says they can or will just never does. So many of my issues are money related so getting a job and making some is the first step to solving my issues. I know it won’t be easy and all sunshine and rainbows but I’m ready and I get nothing but rejections. I have no support system at all. All my friends are not that close they don’t really care about me much. It’s so hard to try and make your way when you have 0 help. Nobody to guide you or atleast lend a hand and set you on a good path. It’s felt like that my whole life. Maybe that’s why my decision making has been so shit. Always picking what I want in the moment and never what’s the hard choice that gives u more in the future. I’m just so sick and tired of feeling so useless and unloved and now I’ve become so damn hopeless I don’t even feel like myself. I always had a lil hope but just seems like this may be my breaking point. Never had someone irl say they care about me or actually do something that shows it. Nobody helps nobody really is invested in Anything abt me what so ever. I’m honestly nothing but super nice and kind and ppl just seem to want bad things for me. I don’t wanna get into it much but everyone has this tendency to pray on my downfall lol. Ik it sounds dramatic but obviously yall don’t know all the details. I just feel so alone with nobody to support me shit sucks so bad. It’s been like this sm in my life. Not even spilling the saddest details of my life cause it’s embarrassing but yea I’m so behind typical life things it sucks so bad. I know what I need to change and do but it’s so hard when step 1 can’t even get done. I been working out for over 7 months and it’s been good for me but now it’s honestly just a nuisance. An hour a day 5-6 times a week I have to dedicate when literally everything else in my life is falling apart. Ugh fuck. I’m so lost and tired and frustrated. Would be nice to here from someone ","**Hello u/!**

i need genuine help,"i can’t understand myself, and i don’t really know who i am.
the words that describes me are confliction and fluctuation, i have self awareness, but i lack self understanding.

somedays i feel fucked up and in the other side i feel the happiest and everything is going perfectly,
somedays i love my close people, somedays i hate them for no reason which is affecting my social life
sometimes i care a lot, and sometimes i never care at all.

i can’t tell what my hobbies or what i like, what music do i even like too? sometimes im in love with metal, sometimes i hate metal!! sometimes i love sudoku and sometimes i hate it, sometimes i’m such an extrovert and sometimes im the most introvert in the room.

i obsess over things and then i end up hating them. i can’t tell what i really like, i can’t answer to “what are your hobbies?” “what’s your favorite music?”
i genuinely love music but i don’t know what i like!!!
when i think about what i like i and especially the most thing i love, music, i feel like i’ve lost my memory, but i have times that i feel like i know myself the most, and then in other times which is now, i don’t know myself at all.

please i can’t understand myself at all, im supposed to know myself more than anyone but i can get to know anyone else than myself.

so my question is what’s wrong with me?
i know i’m 15 and its normal for teenagers and hormones but no i don’t think im normal
what im living is abnormal and i can’t go to a therapist at all.

I can’t stop hating myself for falling asleep,Recently I’ve made this amazing friend and she means so much to me and we tell each other pretty much everything. We usually stay up pretty late just talking to each other and she’s had it tough in some aspects of her life as of recent and she’s hurting and I hate it so bad and I try to be there for her when and if she needs me. She’s strong and doesn’t need me but I always like to be ready cause I don’t want her to have to face this pain alone. I’ve been falling asleep recently where I try to stay up and on occasion it works but just like last night I don’t remember closing my eyes and I hate myself for it. She’s always really sweet and easily one of the kindest people I know and always tries to reassure me it’s okay and I believe her but I can’t forgive myself. I’m not there when she needs me and what if something happens or she just needs someone to listen so she’s not so alone. I keep worrying I’ll drive her away or I’ll fail her so she’s won’t want me around anymore even if though I know she’s not like that. I don’t know why I can’t stop hating myself or being sad over something like this but it won’t stop eating at me and I feel like maybe I should leave her alone so she can find someone more reliable and better to have in her life.,"Forgive yourself. You’re human, your friend is human at some point she’ll fall asleep as well. Just recognize that it might happen and you mean no offense by it if it helps you. || Thank you and maybe I’m just a massive overthinker about what could go wrong when I couldn’t do the simplest thing. I think it’s more than falling asleep like maybe past experiences with other people but whatever case thank you.",1753776549.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc5oad/i_cant_stop_hating_myself_for_falling_asleep/,mentalhealth
I don’t know what I’m feeling… but I need help,"Hi. I’m really struggling right now, and I don’t know how to explain it well. I’ve been having strong urges to cry or hit myself, and I don’t want to feel this way.

Whenever I get anxious, this feeling grows — like I want someone to hit me so I can feel it harder, even though I don’t *like* that. It’s not about liking pain, it’s just that something in me feels like it *needs* that release. It’s scary and exhausting.

When I was a kid, I used to hurt myself — punching, biting, hitting my head against a wall. I even hit my foot with a spoon once when I was angry at my mom. I eventually stopped, but these thoughts still come back sometimes. I don’t act on them anymore, but they’re always there in the background.

Right now, I feel like if I could just cry, I’d feel a little better. But I live in a joint family, and there’s no private space to let it out. It feels like everything is just trapped inside me.

I don’t know if anyone will understand this, but if you’ve felt anything like this — or even if you haven’t — I’d really appreciate someone to talk to or just hear me.

Thank you for reading.","**Hello u/!**

"Is this sleep paralysis, schizophrenia, or something else?","I couldnt sleep, and at around two am, I had a sleep paralysis episode. During said episode, I felt like I was being choked and I could not move, yet I could still see everything around my room. All of a sudden, I felt like I was being pulled up by my hair and like I had been thrown. When I could finally move, I was around three yards from my bed on the floor next to my baby gate (I don't have a door) and I was bleeding from the back of my head, like there was literally blood everywhere. I didn't call anyone, or tell my dad because it was genuinely terrifying and I think/thought my dad would call me a liar, say I did it for attention, or turn me in to a psych ward. Can anyone tell me what's going on? I would appreciate advise by professionals, but outside advice is appreciated. Please tell me what happened and what to do. 

I haven't slept in four days since that happened, I'm terrified. ",I think it’s a mixture of sleep paralysis and maybe vivid dreaming?,1753776210.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc5l8c/is_this_sleep_paralysis_schizophrenia_or/,mentalhealth
Am I being bullied?,"(For some context I am mildly autistic and have a history of childhood abuse.)

I work for a major retailer in the states and have had a pretty unenjoyable experience at my workplace. I find myself seemingly in the wrong for almost every task I do. I rarely ever hear any good feedback and it has deeply effected me. My managers seem to be fraternizing by means of being together at all times and openly talking badly about employees. Whether directly or implied it's clear how they feel. Other employees at my store receive nearly no negative feedback. I'm of the belief that my management team is rife with narcissism. There are numerous rules that management break *daily* but I'm the only one who sees any justice. I wish to go to HR but unfortunately it's my word versus theirs. I so desperately wish to feel better but I just don't know what more I can take. I'm late most days despite my company's allotted grace period and I receive much flack for it. I'm not sleeping or eating well and it's eating me up. I feel stuck between being miserable or being homeless. ","First thing first, thanks for sharing your story it shows how brave you really are.

Do you have health insurance or qualify for help from your state for health insurance. You should try to talk to a doctor about your sleep pattern.

Being able to get enough sleep on a regular basis will greatly improve your life.

Sleeping regularly will help you think more clearly and will help you look for a better job.

Work on getting your sleep problem fixed( maybe you need something prescribed for sleep).

if you feel you are about to be homeless contact your health department and let them know that you need help.
They should be able to connect you with mental health resources and maybe a social worker who can help you through these hard times.",1753762236.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc1r0r/am_i_being_bullied/,mentalhealth
Diagnosing a possible narcissist?,"There is a person at work I am confused by, I am not sure they are entirely a narcissist but they do have some traits I believe.  From below, how would you characterise them: -

They use their personal problems, such as close people that may have died or are ill, they weaponise this and make you feel bad for them when they are put in uncomfortable situations.

They project their own faults onto you.  They will blame you for bringing your personal problems to work, if you get agitated or emotional with their attitude or performance.  If you then question them, they become emotional and try gaining sympathy.

They struggle with direction unless you make them feel they have a part in it.

They struggle to admit fault, will rarely do so.

They will embellish but not outright lie, part of it will be true.  But they can outright lie at times.

Conversation is one way, they never ask about you but are happy to talk about themselves.

They are two faced, will make allies at work that think they are great, but they will bad mouth them. 

They like to control conversation, not letting you speak at all if they had a choice, or speaking over you.

They like control in general.

When backed into a corner they can become agitated and defensive.  You cannot have a calm conversation about a work related issue.

They are very good at defending themselves.  They will have an answer for everything and are very quick.  If in court situation they would be very slippery and hard to pin down.

They get triggered and emotional as soon as anything approaching fault is presented to them.

They can despise someone, but if this someone gives in to them, breaks down and gives complete power to the person in question, they will suddenly sing their praises.

They appear to like power and control over people.

They are amped up and excitable a lot of the time, can’t seem to be relaxed although are on occasion.

Things that make me question if they are a narcissist: -

They seem genuinely upset when they speak of ill loved ones or people that died.

They seem emotional in general, on the edge a lot.

They seem to love animals and kids. They look after their nieces a lot.

They say they had a rough childhood.

They can be pleasant at times, and supportive.

They like being in favour, and liked.

I don’t think they like conflict or confrontation, especially if they are on the back foot.  But at the same time will never admit fault even if presented to them.

I think they feel isolated from the more balanced people at work, maybe feel insecure around anyone with genuine self confidence or any genuinely nice people.

They thrive on praise and if you make them feel important, they will then do their best to support you if it falls within their parameters.

Sometimes the bad mouthing of others may be for genuine reasons.

They like being in the right.  They will rarely do anything that they can directly get in trouble for.","we are not able to diagnose anyone. 

But search up Jordan Peterson, and narcissism, he has a lot of videos on this. 

But I'd ask, 

why is this so important to you? || you are right treating them in a friendly way. I use the BIFF rule I saw on the episode of dealing with high conflict people on the huberman podcast. Brief, informative, friendly, and Firm communication. What you lack is setting firm boundaries and all will be good... || They are affecting me in quite a bad way.  But on some level I feel bad for them, I’d like to help them.  Thank you || Yes there is not a firm boundary.  Things have got a little personal and this is our first big argument.  I think they enjoyed on some level that they got me to that point.  Thank you, a new boundary needs to be established at this point || is there a way you can just avoid them? || Don't argue with them, lol. They will eat you alive. Even if they start the argument, give them minimal responses and set boundaries in a friendly way. || Kind of, I can minimise contact but we are around each other sometimes, part of a shift.  But she likes to talk. I used to listen because I felt bad for her, now I won’t want to.  She will probably notice this and realise I have had enough of her.  Not sure if this will cause her to target me if I don’t act like all is good.  I fear getting entangled with her, and her lying, I just don’t have time for it… || Yeah it was quite annoying because once I got angry they had me over a barrel, as senior I can’t do that.  Thats when I tried de escalating and gave in basically lol.  I set a small boundary in the heat of the moment by saying we can’t do that again.  Will just build on that.  I do feel bad for them but I just have no energy to get sucked into it. || don't feel bad for them because they can't change and have zero empathy, and don't try to reason with them and show them they are wrong. That's a futile exercise. What you should do is document all your interactions with them, even small interactions. And communicate that you have the documentation and that there are consequences for un-professional behavior. Don't engage emotionally.

What do you mean by senior? || Senior as in the care setting, shift leader so nothing big, but big enough to cause me problems.  I will document what happened and see how it goes… || good, it should be easier for you if you are in the management position...",1753775098.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc5b1n/diagnosing_a_possible_narcissist/,mentalhealth
Idk if I’m starting to be addicted to Fortnite 18 F,"I’m not really the type of person to play Fortnite actually I really didn’t play it at all until now. I actually thought it was a pretty overrated game but now I can see why and once I played it I was like you know this game isn’t really too bad. It’s actually pretty cool a couple of weeks ago I bought the battle pass and ever since then I have not gotten off Fortnite now it’s like I’m becoming addicted because I also downloaded the game on my phone. Yes I’m a gamer, but I had a limit to where I needed to take a break I talked to my mom about it because she knows that I’m literally always on the game.  pretty much everyone knows that but I don’t let it affect my life because in my opinion it’s not that serious and I know that too much gaming can cause health problems like headaches and vision, and all that stuff which I am aware. I haven’t played at all today which is good, but I might play later on.","Uninstall it. The first step to solving a problem is recognizing there is one. If you’re worried that you play too much, you probably do.

It seems like you’re doing great considering you didn’t play yesterday. I’m proud of you! Maybe in the future you can return to it and have a healthier relationship with gaming.🩷 || Yes probably.

How can i stop,"Since childhood I have had a strong urge to listen to music because certain types of music put me in a kind of trance/daydream. As a child i usually did this in form of singing and jactitation (twitching body in bed) which stimulates the body, which i can do still. 

I have very little social contact and I think music serves as a substitute. I am convinced that it is destroying my life and my health, like a heroin addiction.

Fascinating.

How is it specifically disrupting your life?

What is it preventing you from doing? || It has a negative effect on my life in that it drains my energy. After listening to music, my brain is „done“ and overstimulated.

"Just gonna vent, read or don’t.","So for the longest time I’ve been not right in my head. Recently whatever is going on mentally has gotten worse. I’ve started telling myself I need therapy. At the same time however, I ask myself why I want therapy? I feel fine some days. Happy. Normal even. Some days though, I don’t even feel real. I have insomnia. I rarely sleep & can go days without sleeping if I choose. My brain never shuts up, I can’t turn it off to go to sleep like other people can. My days often feel like a dream, a haze. I’m constantly moving in slow motion & the world around me feels the same. I feel like I’m floating everyday. I feel like a ghost. I don’t want to feel like this. Some people find comfort in these things. I don’t. I don’t like attention, I don’t like asking for help. Part of me thinks I don’t need help, a part deep down does and is screaming at me to find someone who will. I’m the therapist friend. Yk. Always the saver, never the saved. I don’t believe anyone could ever understand me anyways. I always shut down. I want to explain everything, even the things I don’t know how to explain but I can’t. 

I’ve been diagnosed with severe high-functioning depression at seven. That I do know. I got diagnosed after my parents divorced. For context: My dad was an angry, abusive, alcoholic. That’s why my parents split. I’ve forgiven him now because he quit & got help for the sake of my brother and I. My mom however, is very emotionally absent. I can’t remember the last time I’ve gotten a hug from her, let alone told her how I’m feeling. I’ve heard more mean things from her than I ever have good, so I’ve never opened up to her. I’m the oldest daughter so that probably says a lot… I actually am terrified of disappointing her because I often do. I don’t ever want to go out either. I quit my first job a year ago before I even found another one. Big mistake. Now I’ve been jobless, alone with my thoughts. My only friend, since fifth grade, left me for a man and blamed me for the reason she stopped checking up on me, she’s just left me on read or replied with, “sorry I’m busy text you later.” So I stopped reaching out. They often say if you never messaged first who would reach out & truly I can’t think of one person who would think about me if I just stopped talking. I can’t cry anymore. Not a sad cry. When I’m sad I’m really just numb. Blank. I haven’t cried out of sadness for a long time. The only time I cry is out of frustration or stress which is all the time. Stress, lack of sleep, depression, no support. Not even parents who care enough to talk to me or take me seriously. Is changing me. My brain. I don’t think I’d ever hurt myself or someone else. My empathy is much stronger than my problems & I am grateful to be alive. I think getting the chance to experience life is a blessing. But I want a different one. A different reality. I’m constantly in a state of dissociation. One more thing is… in the past year, ever since I quit my job and lost my best friend, I started to create a new persona of myself. A shield. I don’t know what this means. But now I feel like there’s two of me. The first lie I told was my name. Then she became real. Evie. She doesn’t flinch when the world turns cold. She’s Someone softer. Someone lighter. She’s everything I wished I had the courage to be… I don’t know which voice to follow anymore. I have completely lost sight of who I am.

I’ve been feeling better since I started using Reddit. How weird is that?,"I’ve been feeling a lot better emotionally since I started using Reddit. And honestly, I don't know what to think about it. I’ve found that just reading other people’s experiences and even interacting with random threads actually lifts my mood. It’s like a weird form of emotional release, happening almost without me realizing it. Why is it having this effect on me? I know Reddit isn’t exactly a mental health space—it’s a social media platform with loops and ads to make money off of us, I get that. So why does it feel like it’s actually helping? Honestly, it feels a little strange to be getting emotional comfort from a site full of strangers. It kind of makes me wonder if it’s a bit unhealthy or if I’m just overthinking it. Do you think it’s healthy to find long-term emotional support her, or is it just a temporary fix?","Not weird at all. People are becoming increasingly diverse in how they think and act, to the point that for some, it’s genuinely difficult to find meaningful interaction with others in their local daily life. The internet is a great connector of sorts, so long as it’s used in that way. 

The harp against social media is almost always the side of only looking at people who seem to lead incredible lives. They see a single photo of people smiling, there’s only ever photos of them smiling, and they see so many other people doing the same thing that if can make those looking think it’s normal to be that way all the time. As if that one frame of their life represents a constant stream of happiness through much of their life.

Reddit is honestly pretty far from that. A few spaces like that may exist, and the opposite side of that are spaces of excessive negativity that honestly also show up in any social media space. But I stay away from all that. It’s incredibly easy to spot.

More specifically, same. Very much same. In all my life, I have met maybe 1 person who feels a *little* bit like me. Someone who isn’t entirely afraid of being honest about who they are, and who doesn’t entirely mind opening up now and then. Someone I can sort of talk with like this. But online? Dozens. Hundreds. For once in my life, I’ve even actually been able to say I see people who *are* like me, even if they’ve been shaped differently by their life experiences. Maybe like… 3 or 4 in total, and a dozen more that are still eerily similar, but it’s jarring. To see things I haven’t seen in anyone else before, yet to immediately recognize it because I’ve always been so keenly aware of what makes me different from others. They don’t become friends or anything, sometimes it’s even just in passing, but it’s helped me to at least better understand myself when I see these things in other people. It’s helped me figure what makes me “me”.

Kind of like… just chatting with strangers on an elevator. You don’t orient your entire state of wellbeing around that experience, and you don’t necessarily expect a lot of it. It’s just nice. You see different people. You get to see a variety of different personalities.

And you may be a bit like me, it’s hard to say for sure, but I’m excessively empathetic. Not hyper-empathy, I can still keep myself from feeling the emotions of others, but I’ve come to realize I love learning about people. It drives my brain in almost weird ways.

It’s nice. I don’t think it has to be unhealthy at all, because I’m the sort of person that is far too unique for my own good. I don’t blame others, but most people in my life can’t really begin to actually understand me. I interact, I try to have to fun, but it isn’t quite *me* either. I just need an outlet now and then. || Not weird at all.
The online community can support you, too.
People can share tips, advice, and guidance and Kindle a sense of belonging. 
I know people who are part of online communities because it's a way of connecting with others. || It’s the feeling of connection that makes you feel better. Honestly I mean it could be a long term solution but also it’s not as good as having a group of close friends who are there for you || Automated tech can do amazing things. Dw were mostly human here. Commonality and compassion. || I understand why close friends are a healthier solution, but it feels like it gets harder to find new ones as the years go by. If you already have close friends, why would you need more?

Advice for a Struggling Professional,"Hi all. I'm posting for a friend who stays off social media but is looking for support.

\-

I’m sharing this hoping someone understands. Maybe you’ve lived through this. Maybe you have advice. Maybe you’re just trying to keep going without masking.

I was diagnosed late with Autism and ADHD. I had already survived PTSD, panic disorder, and OCD while climbing the corporate ladder. I’ve worked since I was 12. Inventory. Bookstores. Haunted hayrides. Mascot gigs.

I put myself through college holding a job. I was relentless. Smart. Social. I spoke to execs easily. I moved fast, succeeded, survived.

Then one day, during a conference call, I couldn’t pick up the phone. I started to sweat. The room went cold.

What followed were years of panic attacks, hospital visits, misdiagnoses, and finally: answers. I was dealing with mental illness, neurodivergence I’d never known. Through therapy, meds, and will, I kept working. I thrived. I was president of my company’s Disability Employee Resource Group.

When an edict came that everyone had to RTO, I tried. But the burnouts came. Panic returned. I decided to disclose.

I believed in the system as an idealist. I led the disability group. I could ask for accommodation.

What followed was a gauntlet of degrading 3rd-party forms and phone calls. I was asked to specify the date and time of my next panic attack.

But I “won” the accommodation.

In reality, my boss began treating me like I was broken. They removed my laptop from my desk mid typing, walked me silently to an empty conference room. I was slowly pushed out.

I took another job, this time with more awareness of the risks of disclosure. I pivoted to a company that claimed to align with my values. Then COVID hit. I was laid off.

I kept going. I recruited for vaccine efforts. Got another contract. And another. I landed at one of the top three.

Then something extraordinary happened: my spouse looked at me and said, “take a break.”

I did. For the first time in my life. Everything changed.

I went back to school—certified in marketing, acted at a prestigious academy. I returned to the stage for the first time in a while. That moment—the curtain rising, the audience watching—was a triumph.

I found a doctor who listened. I did comprehensive testing. The diagnosis: Autism and ADHD. Everything made sense. My masking. My breakdown. Even my love of drama—how it helped me survive in a world that never saw the full me.

I’ve rebuilt my life on truth, not performance.

I use slimes, weighted blankets, and routines that regulate my nervous system. I found therapy that works. My panic attacks are rare. My joy is real. And in my most recent role—a contract job extended because I exceeded every expectation—I worked 15-hour days, killed it, and stayed remote.

I simply gave myself autonomy and flourished.

Now the contract is ending. It’s one of the hardest job markets I’ve seen. DEI is under attack. There’s another big push for RTO. I’m scared. But also hopeful.

Here’s what I need:

* Advice from other late-diagnosed neurodivergent professionals.

* Allies inside companies fighting for real inclusion.

* Leads for remote roles.

* Encouragement.

I’m not done. Not even close.

I’ve fought hard to become who I am, and I believe—deeply—that people like me don’t just deserve a seat at the table. We make the table better. If you’re still reading: thank you. If you’ve lived this: I see you. If you know of something that fits me: I’m here. And still rising.","Your story is a powerful testament to the importance of understanding oneself deeply, especially after navigating so many challenges with misdiagnoses and societal pressures. The process you described, where comprehensive testing led to clarity and then to specific strategies and accommodations, highlights how crucial a thorough diagnostic picture can be for effective treatment and thriving.

I don't have specific advice or leads for you, but I wanted to comment to provide encouragement and visibility. Good luck and keep at it!",1753760331.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc152q/advice_for_a_struggling_professional/,mentalhealth
What does this mean?,I’m just really confused about myself. I feel like I’m broken into two parts. A side of me that loves people and is a normal person. The other half hates people and wants to harm them. I feel like my good side is like slowly dying and I’m trying to hold onto it so I don’t like turn into a bad person and lose my humanity. But at the same time I feel like my humanity is still there like it’s not dying and I’m feeling really confused about that. And I don’t want my bad side to take over because I don’t want to hurt people but at the same time I want it to take over so I can hurt people. The good side cares about everyone no matter how bad they are or how much wrong they done but the other side cares about no one even my little sister who means a lot to me. I’m really confused and don’t know what to do because I really want to tell someone but when I try to say something I can’t say anything like my mouth has been sewn up. And I’m afraid what others would say or think about me. I want help because idk how long I can take this. ,"your possessed!

Find a priest ASAP! 

Naw, seriously though, 

it's possible these 2 half's are waring in you because  our society is currently  going through a massive transformation, where almost no one can discuss current events without demonizing the other side.  

If however, 

This has been going on before 2016, that might be more serious.... I suspect not though. || I better find VelociPastor even though he’s a pastor not a priest. And it started a little after my dad pasted away in 2017 so I think you’re right about the waring inside of me but when he pasted away I had a deep hatred for myself so I think it stemmed from that and I had certain feeling towards others like I wanted to lash out without caring who it was and I think that just became like it’s own little person inside of me",1753773535.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc4wxi/what_does_this_mean/,mentalhealth
I'm 28 and alone for over 6 years and I can't bare it anymore,"I can't stand being alone anymore. I ALWAYS avoid eye contact when I feel like someone is really looking at me personally.

I think that's why I never feel close to other people, and that's what I mean by being alone.

I bet it sounds pretentious, but ironically, sometimes a lot of people look at me and smile nicely when I'm talking to a friend and laughing, for example.

So yes, I have a friend, and now you might think I'm not alone, but three months ago, he and others in a group of friends kicked me out because I felt I was being treated unfairly and ended up talking a little louder and more intimidatingly. I know it wasn't right, and I did it because I felt belittled all the time anyway, and I was depressed about it. Nevertheless, there is no question in my mind that I was treated that way at times, even if I handled it wrong. The friend I still hang out with apologized to me for it and said that kicking me out wasn't planned and that it was excessive, even though it looked very planned (everyone supposedly voted for me to leave).

That's why I still find it difficult because I wouldn't treat anyone like that as a friend.



I would love to have a girlfriend I feel comfortable with



I think that's possible because, ironically, I often get clear signals from girls that they see me that way too. I know that might be hard to believe, but it's true, and I almost feel like being alone for so long and somehow enduring it makes it attractive.

Nevertheless, I never try it, because I always want it to feel “right” for me, so I know that I can just react naturally without having to be afraid, so I intuively know that “something” will come of it.

As I said, I think that's possible, but it takes a really long time. On the other hand, it's also difficult to focus on it too much. I don't know what the right balance is, because I don't want to feel like I'm artificially creating something.

It just feels so weird when, on the one hand, I want to feel naturally connected to the person, which can only happen on its own, and at the same time I'm always analyzing “what's possible right now” in that moment (how I should act so that I “get” the girl). It's a contradiction.



I'm really sorry. I understand how complicated it sounds.

I just wished I wasn't so absorbed in my negative thoughts and feelings of myself ","hi! i dont know if my advice is gonna be any good but im gonna try. Even though i dont know you im sorry your supposed friends treated you that way. i think that no matter what your personality is or how it shows if you find good friends, even if someday they dont talk to you anymore its certainly not gonna be by voting you out of the group. i didnt even know that was a thing people do. really shitty. 

regarding your contradicting feelings, from what i understood you want relationships to be made naturally and therefore be natural all the way, but honestly whats “natural” really? no one is always just living carefree without thinking or acting according to an objective. you may feel overwhelmed by your contradiction but that contradiction is just you wanting to bond with people. so what i want to say really is, first of all, that is okay to feel that way and to feel contradicted, its only natural when you want to achieve something by not doing the thing you need to do to achieve it.
well i think im dragging it. my advice is that you try to refrain yourself from avoiding people because you dont think its natural or that it wouldnt work. try to connect with people, meet new people, challenge yourself. while you may not want to and you may meet people or look at people or interact with people youll regret in the future, at least youll have one more moment not to be alone, maybe, and maybe among the people you meet one or two will be the people youll be able to be with as a good friend for life.

what im trying to say is, the thing i think you can really start by doing is not avoiding but reaching, and then maybe things will start going a different path.
oh, and about the artificially created friendships, i dont think these will happen if youre not pretending to be someone you are not, which i dont think youre doing. from what i understood youre only worried about making the most out of a relationship and that may make you do things or behave in ways that will appear to you as “artificial”, but i dont think they are. and even if they are somehow, again, if you find good people to be with i promise thats not gonna be a problem. 

welp, sorry if i said useless or stupid things, i hope i was some kind of help! if you want to talk im pretty sure my dms are open (i dont use reddit that much) || I’m sorry man.",1753746029.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbw4ro/im_28_and_alone_for_over_6_years_and_i_cant_bare/,mentalhealth
I really want to go,"I really wanted to go away fast. The uncertainty for what I want for my future is killing me. I can't trust anyone even my family. They don't like me, I don't like talking to anyone either because of repetitive dismissal and disappointment from being misunderstood. I feel like giving up already. Sharing my feelings to anyone always end up feeling like I must not have a feeling so that I won't get upset. That's the reason I detached from anyone, even my family. I already gave chances, I'm generous and tried lots of strategies so that they can get close to me, and that I can get close to them too. But whenever I get upset or share my feelings, I get dismissed, they always want them to be understood, when I was the one asking for understanding. I tend to just surrender to their ideals that they are the ones to be understood and that their feelings matter more than what I feel, even if I was the one sharing my problems. I don't feel like living in a life like this anymore. I just want to d*e, I almost k*lled myself a while ago with a knife. I'm not that well off, so living alone or seeking psych help is out of the picture. I tried visiting the psych before, I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder and mild bipolar something. I really can't deal with anything anymore. But if there's one last way out, please help me. ","**Hello u/!**

I think my mom is having a schizophrenic episode and I don’t know what to do,"Hi everyone, I’ll try to keep this short since the title mainly gives it away.

My mom has recently not been acting like herself lately. She was in a very bad relationship for a long time and that recently stopped because he is in jail now. I will not go into details because that story is a whole mess of its own.

However, ever since that happened she has just been falling down this spiral. She barely leaves the house, lashes out at everything and everyone, and is just super confrontational and aggressive. She takes a lot out on me and blames me for her not leaving the house a lot. But recently it got much worse. She thinks the ex sent demons on her. She says she hears them and always feels like she’s being touched and hurt by them. She thinks our cats are scared all the time and is convinced that he did this. She even brought in a priest to bless the house. 

I looked some things up and saw that this stuff can be caused by trauma and loss, but I don’t know for sure. She regrets that he’s in jail now. She says all these awful things and I’m at a loss. I leave again for college in a few weeks and I feel utterly hopeless. She’s convinced I don’t care for her and she’s straight up said that she finds me annoying and I make everything about me. 

I’m too scared to call any authorities because I know she’ll never forgive me and she’s a very vindictive and vengeful person, she’d probably do something just to spite me. Please, I need any advice I can get. I feel hopeless.","The only advice I can offer is to call the authorities.
It is what’s best for her and she needs psychiatric help ASAP. This sounds like psychosis, the longer you let her go without treatment the worse it’ll get. || Dial 988 for the USA and ask for an MCRT (mobile crisis response team))

I hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either. And honestly, I don’t think anyone can help me, other than ending it all.

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half, but it only seems to help for a few hours at a time.

Nausea or dizziness due to anxiety?,"Does anybody else feel extremely nauseous and dizzy when they are stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed?
I am also having tension headaches and pain in my shoulder and neck that becomes almost unbearable. And none of the normal painkillers helps.
Any advice?","Yes most of this is unfortunately normal.
However I’d see a doctor about the pain in your shoulder and neck. Typically I don’t see people describing anxiety pains as ‘unbearable’. || I’ve actually done some research on this. When a person is in a constant state of anxiety or stress for a long time, their shoulders tend to stay slightly raised. It might not be noticeable, but this ongoing tension means the muscles are being contracted continuously without proper relaxation. That prolonged contraction can lead to muscle pain and tightness.

Another important point is that magnesium plays a key role in muscle relaxation after contraction. But when we’re under stress, magnesium levels tend to drop mainly due to increased excretion which makes it even harder for the muscles to relax, creating a cycle of tension.

Also, during the fight-or-flight response, the body prioritizes survival, so energy and blood flow shift away from functions it considers “non-essential” at the moment, like digestion. I’ve struggled with severe digestive issues, nausea, and dizziness, and I’ve noticed that when I take alprazolam, it helps with the nausea which suggests it’s anxiety-related.

In this stressed state, breathing can become shallow and blood flow may shift, sometimes leading to a sensation of reduced oxygen to the brain, which can contribute to dizziness and headaches.

When neck and shoulder muscles are constantly tense or strained, they can irritate surrounding nerves and tissues. This tension can cause pain that radiates to the head, often resulting in tension headaches. Sometimes I feel the pain in my forehead, and other times at the back of my skull. It’s unbearable at times.

It’s all deeply interconnected stress, anxiety, digestion, muscle tension, and headaches. || You’ll never know unless you go to the doctor. However stress can cause muscle pain. You may want to try and see if they can prescribe muscle relaxers for that pain.",1753772385.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc4m9f/nausea_or_dizziness_due_to_anxiety/,mentalhealth

Can someone help me out? I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with me,"I’d rather not share specifics of the situations but I will, if necessary. 

To begin; here are a list of things I struggle with

-Noticeable struggle to make deep bonds with friends and family

-Noticeable struggle to remember certain things to the point of frustration 

-Overstimulation (or what I believe is overstimulation) leading to episodes of lashing out at people in social settings

-Struggles with speech (occasional, but again noticeable) 

-Miscommunication leading to frustration

-Struggles with identity (not really knowing who I am as a person besides very basic aspects)

If this helps, I am fifteen and male with back issues.

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit to post this to, I would just like possible solutions and why I could be feeling this way.
Thanks!","figuring yourself out doesnt mean something’s wrong it means you care. || Not sure I would use the word ""wrong,"" but you just listed a bunch of things you struggle with and presumably want to work on. Adding a diagnosis or label won't help other than having language to help explain to people without going into the nitty gritty of it. Also insurance companies like the diagnosis lol.

It can be tempting when we are struggling to find a root ""cause,"" like if I can find a cause, then I can just fix it, right? Mental health isn't that simple. It's a lot introspection, building self awareness, and learning to be less all or nothing. This ultimately will make it easier to see things more objectively, make concrete goals and break things down into more manageable steps.

Honestly I wish I had learned this earlier myself so I hope this helps. || This has been helpful to hear, but if there is something wrong (which is more likely than not) I’d like to be able to approach a mental health professional and get help. Knowing what could POSSIBLY be wrong would help me in this, and then I could find methods of regulation that help me personally before I am officially diagnosed. || Don't get me wrong, if you see a mental health profession your more likely than not gonna end up with a diagnosis anyway. Your not gonna be able to find that diagnosis on your own before hand and even if you find something that matches it won't nessisarly be the diagnosis they stick you with though.

What I said is more just something to keep in mind for yourself throughout. Like I said the diagnosis will happen anyway regardless. I don't want to discourage your from reading or learning more, just something to keep in mind. It's easy to get lost in the label stuff. It can sometimes feel like ""oh I am this way because of x"" which when it comes to mental health can be pretty all or nothing since even with symptoms you still have your individual personality and physiology. Those x factors so to speak will allow you to figure out your strengths and weakness and what you can and/or want to work on. I've seen a a lot of people write themselves off simply because ""I have x diagnosis.""

Anyway like I said it's more just something to keep in mind. I would encourage you to do some reading, we can sit here and speculate, but nobody here can diagnose you.

Secondly, I've had this, thing for ages now, I can't remember when it started, but what I do is I create fake scenarios in my head, and there can be a lot of variation, so this is just one of them, but when I see cool people on the street or whenever, I imagine going up to them and talking, and them not minding that I'm awkward, and we have a really nice chat, and their just as cool as they look. The problem is I get so wrapped up in this scenario of mine, that not only do I make little to no effort to actually reach out to them, but even if I did, I already have these memories and ideas of what I their like in my head, and it's never the same, and it's jarring, and a total disconnect. Now I kinda already know why I do this, it's pretty obvious to me, it's because I think it's safer to pretend, to not actually risk an interaction that could go sideways, and instead stay in my comfort zone. 
What I really want to know, is how the hell do I stop??? I spend way too much time in my head, and when I come back down the real world looks so much worse and scarier in comparison, please, if anybody out there has gone through this, or has any advice please, please help",,1753758308.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc0h3r/i_need_to_know_how_i_can_stop_this/,mentalhealth
I hate everything and I can't stop.,"Reddit, I am a bad guy. At least that's what I've been told my whole life. My parents used to yell at me to the point of calling ss, my ""friends"" would do stupid shit and blame me for it, and everytime I'd get a girlfriend she'd cheat or she'd leave or she'd do both. I hate waking up and looking in the mirror knowing what i look like. I push everyone away because of my appearance.  
I started sh on my birthday of this year, and I haven't stopped. My current girlfriend is about to leave me, she already brought it up twice. I want to end it all and i want to keep living. I have a personality disorder where I go from one person to another (like the movie Split) and I can't keep going on. I don't want comments telling me to seek help because ffs I've tried. I am so tired of feeling hated and hating everyone. i just...if someone could love me for me, you know? if someone could care the way i care about the people i love, then maybe I could start there.
Please reddit, I don't know what to do. ","**Hello u/!**

What is this that I’m experiencing?,"I’m (25F) going to try to explain this as best as I can and I honestly have no clue what’s going on. 

So sometimes I get these random dissociative episodes (that’s the best way I can describe it) and they’ll start with thoughts that don’t feel like they’re mine. Then I’ll get this like sickening feeling in my stomach and I’ll feel hot and cold at the same time and my body feels like I’ve been dipped in soda. It’s incredibly uncomfortable. Usually I can fight it off and stay conscious/ in my body but when I can’t, I’ll pass out for like 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Most of the time I’ll “wake up”where I pass out but sometimes I’ll wake up in a different room. When I do pass out, it’s like I blinked and a bunch of time has passed so no thoughts or anything. When I fight it off, it completely exhausts me and i need to rest afterwards. 

I talked to my therapist and she has no idea what’s going on, she just suggested I find ways to ground myself when it does happen. Which works most of the time but sometimes I still pass out. 

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and AuDHD so I know what the symptoms of a panic attack or something feels like and this is nothing like that. It started in December of 2023 and mostly didn’t happen in 2024 but has happened more often in 2025. I was on all kinds of SSRI’s for 15 years but haven’t been on them for several months as the latest one (Lexapro) made me feel like a zombie and I was discouraged from trying another bc I’ve tried so many and the only one that worked was Sertraline but I maxed out on the dosage a few years ago so it stopped working and I haven’t found one that works since. 

It definitely occurs more often when I’m anxious but I know this isn’t what a panic attack feels like at all. I thought maybe it was bc I wasn’t on SSRI’s anymore but again, it’s been months and this happens randomly. Like I had been fine for months and then it happened like twice in one day a month ago but it’s happened like 6 times in the past 24 hours. I have no idea what’s triggering them so I have no idea how to stop them from happening. 

I am so sick of it. I desperately want them to stop but doctors have been useless. Does anyone experience anything like this or know what it is??

Help feeling connection again,"Hello, I apologize if this does not fit with the subreddit and I understand if others need help first.

My life feels empty and meaningless. As if every facet of my being: home life, work life, and social life are all just things I have to survive so I can wake up tomorrow. I have no grand guiding vision or want besides to feel happy again. I have recently made meaningful steps to improve my life, but it still feels empty. Sometimes I feel on top of the world and other times buried beneath it. I look back to when I was happy and find a major thing I now lack: connection.

I now feel like every relation in my life is hollow and any attempt I do at making them meaningful is met with disinterest. I have maybe one or two people who text me without me texting first. I don't see anyone else that often either. Even while I work customer service, I am not really expected to get into intimate conversation while serving their food. I cannot relate to my coworkers as they talk about experiences I yearn for and cannot have. I try to text old friends and am met with conversations where I am asking questions hoping for something deeper, people who seem down to hangout but cancel last minute, or am left on seen. Back in school, I knew a decent chunk of people and could strike up conversation and briefly hang with people. I would tutor people at subjects I excelled at. But it never went outside of school because I had no transportation to meet with anyone. And now I do, but nobody to see and meet as I have since graduated.

Coming To Terms That The Little Voice In My Head Is Sometimes Right,"I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, adhd and OCD for years. Over and over this voice in my head has told me something that unfortunately seems true. I will never truly be someone’s number one. My bio dad never loved me and said as much on my 16th birthday. My mom’s an alcoholic and her love is transactional. Over the years I came to terms that my bestie of over a decade never saw me as her number one. My ex spouse put herself before me for 12 years until I finally just left. I thought I found someone who would put me first. I’m pretty sure I was wrong about that, too. 

I commented on something off colored his friends said and asked why he would want to be friends with people who think that way. His response was that he has known them forever and that I didn’t have to like them but I needed to accept that he was friends with them or we wouldn’t work out. 

We’ve been together a year and a half and I love him. He does a lot for me. And I do mean a lot. But that sentence brought me back to the foreground of my own reality. If I’m going to be anyone’s number one, I’m going to have to be my own number one. It actually really hurts. That shitty voice in my head was right. 

I never asked him to dump his friends, I really wanted to understand. Because the comments they make have me questioning their morals. But 
I was met with a comment that made me have to swallow a metaphorical pill I didn’t wanna swallow. I don’t want any relationship advice, but I do want to know if anyone else feels this way. Like despite making meaningful connections you never are met with that same energy? Like your priority people don’t have you at that same level for them.

There have been so many friends I made where I put my full investment into the relationship. Obviously I don’t expect a friend to make me their number one, especially after they get married. That would be insane. But I hoped to be in the top list, especially if we become super close. 

I’m super loyal and always have my friends backs, but that effort is never returned the same. Some friends stay close still while most others eventually back burner me. Is this a neurodivergent thing or something? And I alone here?

Do I go to therapy for what I think is a fear of the dark?,"This post is a vent/question. For some context, I am currently in high school and this topic is something that I have only ever talked about once and rarely thought about until recently (when I discovered that the things I do aren’t normal). To start, when I was a child I had the common fear of the dark but there were certain monsters that I vividly remember. For example, there was a monster that I named “Top hat man” who is a pure black, humanoid figure that used to stand in the hallway outside of my shared room (with my sister) when my sister left the room to bathe at night. The premise is that he would be there when i was alone in the room at night (even with the nightlight on) and he would stare, but I could not do anything that would let him know that I knew he was there. If I did alert him that I knew he was there, the perceived consequence was death (i think). The second instance of this still during my childhood was “treeman,” who was very similar in figure but had a more shadowy essence. The prerequisites for him to show up was that I had to be in a car driving *away* from my house at night. When those were fulfilled, treeman would appear in the shadows of trees, and it was the same thing I cannot do anything that would let treeman know that I knew he was there. Okay, now, both of those were things in my childhood that don’t happen anymore, but there is one creature that is still with me today. (I want to preface this with i’m not schizophrenic, I never actually see these creatures this is just what I imagine them to look like). I call this one “The watcher.” It appears at night when the light is off and when i’m in bed. My bed is next to a wall on my right side and a few feet away from my closet on my left side. The watcher is next to the closet. The watcher doesn’t have any specific form. When i’m trying to sleep at night The watcher appears and watches me, making sure i’m asleep. So, what i’ll do is not open my eyes no matter what and stay under a blanket (i live in a very hot and humid place so ill sweat) no matter how much im sweating. I don’t like facing the closet when he’s there (yes, even with my eyes closed) so i’ll roll over to face the wall. However, after facing the wall for some time i’ll realize that, to the watcher, i’m being suspicious, so i’ll roll back over. It’s the same thing, I can’t do anything that will let the watcher know that I know it’s there. I will also fold in the sides of my blankets to make sure no entrance in accessible from the outside and fully over myself (aside from a breathing hole) with a blanket to feel safe. In general, whenever it’s dark in my room I just get anxious and when I get up to turn the light on my anxiety sky rockets and I have to rush to turn them on. I haven’t slept with my lights off in months purely to avoid seeing the watcher at night. For so long I just never talked or even thought about the watcher because it didn’t happen every night and I just didn’t think it was cause for concern. But, I told my sister recently and she very quickly let me know that it was in fact not normal. I also felt like it was like taboo to be discussing the watcher outloud, it felt like I would be letting it know that I knew it was there. So, is this worth going to therapy over? Is there anything I can do to reduce my fear? ","I’m so sorry, OP. This sounds like a terrifying and exhausting experience. In my opinion, you just considering therapy is a sign to go. I have no background in psychology, so take all of this with a grain of salt - these monsters are causing you great distress and regardless if they are “real” or not, they are negativity impacting your life. Talking to a professional might give you some clarity as to why you are experiencing this and come up with solutions to cope. I hope you can get some good sleep soon. || thank you for your reply🙏 i think im gonna ask my mom for like a psychiatrist or something",1753768886.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc3p4v/do_i_go_to_therapy_for_what_i_think_is_a_fear_of/,mentalhealth
I want to disappear because I gained weight,"I just turned 19, so I’m a grown woman now. I have a normal weight for a healthy body; I’m neither fat nor skinny. In the last few months, since I started university, I’ve gained a few kilograms. Stress, hormonal changes, chaotic eating on the go, and a lot of sitting due to studying—all of this has ensured good academic performance, but also a few extra kilos.

Right now, I hate my body, I hate myself, I hate looking in the mirror. Every acquaintance who sees me says, “Wow, you’ve gained weight.” And even though I know it’s true, it hurts. Especially because I’m actually working to lose weight. I exercise, I maintain a calorie deficit. But losing weight will take a few months, and I hate interacting with people out of fear they will judge me for gaining weight.

At 16, I had about the same weight as now, and because of bullying I lost so much weight that I fell into anorexia. I was anorexic for a year and a half, then reached a weight that put me in the “skinny” category. Now I’m no longer skinny, I consider myself ugly, I believe no one can love me because I don’t fit beauty standards.

And to make it even worse, my mother tells me that I’ve “put on weight.” My mother, who has been overweight for as long as I can remember. It hurts so much. It feels like people define me as a person only through my physical appearance and see nothing else.

Now I find it hard to leave the house, to socialize. I just want to disappear until I lose weight.



","It hurts a lot to feel like this. Tell others to stop commenting on your body. Get some therapy to deal with your own relationship with your body. Buy/thrift some clothes that fit your body now if you don't have them. Gently and lovingly lose a little if you do want to. 

Don't sacrifice your mental and physical health and huge amount of time, money and resources instead of being healthy and having fun x || Are you struggling with an ED? You mentioned anorexia- that’s very serious and I encourage you to immediately reach out to any and all health services at your university and especially seek out support from peers. Your mom must know what you’re suffering and you must tell her immediately to shut the hell up! Gaining weight at Uni is the most common experience for women, you are definitely not alone. You are forbidden to hate yourself based on weight or appearance! Change your perception of being “judged.” People will always have something to say, but their comments don’t have to be given any importance. We don’t submit ourselves to the “judgment” of others, so we’re not going to waste time trying to appeal to anyone else’s opinion. We will never escape the notice of others and to the people who know us and see us regularly, they will notice changes in our bodies, behavior, etc and they will say so. That’s an objective fact, but we don’t have to assign negativity to those observations when they are just fact based and not personal attacks and nasty. You get to decide how you want to be and live and present yourself in the world. If you want to make changes, do so without shame or fear or guilt. You can always get back on track even if it’s the 500th time. No one has to be ok with you more than you do. Don’t disappear, claim your space and own it. You belong wherever you want to be in whatever size you are. No situation is permanent, every possibility is available to people who understand that what someone looks like is the least interesting thing about them. || I’m sure you’re still beautiful but I totally understand. Honestly, don’t hide away, just work on losing some weight as best as you can || Yes to all of this. And as a former college/University student, higher education level stress is something else. You could love what you are learning but it's still stressful. Stress alone can lead to body changes. Weight fluctuating, loss of hair, acne even.
Be kind to yourself please OP. Seek mental health support. You deserve to feel happy and at peace in your body. And I 100% also agree and wanted to point out again. Please, don't feel bad in telling others to NOT comment on your body.

Weed destroyed my mind,"I just turned 15 when I succumbed to peer pressure and tried weed. It was fun, and I had a good time with friends. I kept doing it weekly for about 2 months when I realized something was wrong. I had lost all motivation to do school work and had no motivation to keep going. I felt tired all the time and just kind of emotionally numb and dissasosiated with reality. One Friday night, I decided to take an edible. Not any more than usual, only about 35 milligrams. All was going well until I started to freak out. I was just panicking and was scared I would have to go to the hospital and that my parents would find out. I eventually managed to go to sleep and woke up feeling very groggy. The next couple of days I felt very disconnected from reality and had lots of brain fog. About a week after this I mentally broke. Nothing felt real. I was in a constant state of panic and dread and felt like I was going to die 24/7. I would try to calm down but because of how fake everything felt I just felt like i was going insane and freak out even more. I couldn't hang out with friends without having a panic attack. I stopped going to school. My grades plummeted. My mother tried to help but couldn't do much. All I did was cry and I would think about suicide almost everyday. I would feel physically sick too. I would be dizzy, nauseous, fatigued. Nothing would help. As the months past, it gradually got a little better. I managed to pass the school year with okay grades and was finally able to hang out with friends more. Its been 6 months since. My anxiety levels are still higher than normal and I find it hard to sleep most nights, but its nothing compared to what it was. When im outside or in a public place like a store or a mall my head feels foggy and I feel like I cant process all of the imagery at once. Im starting to loose hope I will be the happy person I once was, and if I will ever overcome this horrible mental illness. I just want some support and for somebody to let me know I can fix this if I can.","Hey, things will be alright. Some people don’t respond well to weed and that’s okay. There’s some people who may have been okay with it before but then it changed later on. The feelings you are having can be a common experience. I don’t want to alarm you, but some people might have a few lasting effects. Don’t let that discourage you though. Recovery is possible, you might just need some help along the way. I suggest you speak with a doctor, preferably a psychiatrist. If you are open to it, they might be able to prescribe some medicine to help ease your symptoms. Only they’ll be able to educate you on where you currently stand with your health. And even if they do, it doesn’t mean you have to be on them forever. If your family can afford it, therapy would be helpful as well as finding some support groups who have experienced this as well. This happens to many people so you are not alone in your experience. It’s going to be a rough ride, but you still have the potential to regain some normalcy in your life. ",1753768497.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc3l63/weed_destroyed_my_mind/,mentalhealth
Got sexually harassed today,"Today, my girlfriend and i went to a Korean spa and enjoyed ourselves.

I decided to book my gf a 1hr massage so I can have more time in the sauna. Anyways, went back to the men’s section and sat in the sauna.

I go in, saw this guy come in - think an old version of the comic guy from Simpson. He looks at me weirdly and I dogged him back. Anyways go to close my eyes to relax, I hear him ‘scratching’ and was confused. The second time I close it, I hear it again and saw him scratching his stomach. The third time, I pretended to and saw him playing with himself. I immediately asked him stop what you’re doing and he plays dumb. And I tell him to get the fuck out and he leaves. I went to report it and this guy puts on his mask and clothes and tried to run out of the building. It was p funny because he was too big for the sliding door and it closed on him 🤣. Once he realized he was stuck he opened the door and ran off before the manager could catch him. 

I honestly wished instead of telling him to gtfo, I knocked his fatass out instead.","**Hello u/!**

I don't belong in life,"(30f) I just don't have what it takes to ever thrive in life.

I'm not going to harm myself, I'm too weak for it.

I have CFS so I'm perpetually too exhausted to thrive, that in itself is enough. Then you add severe depression, agoraphobia, and austim into the mix. I can't function well enough to pull myself out of this, every year I get worse. 

I can't afford professional help, free/low cost services say they can't accept me because I have constant suicidal ideation. I make too much money for financial support but not enough to actually afford medical care after all the bills are paid. 

I did receive therapy for a year some time ago until I couldn't afford it anymore and I didn't get better. I've been in maybe 5 different medications months trails for each, I didn't get better. Before my condition that now makes exercise not an option I tried that too and it just made me feel worse (likely due to my condition before I was aware of it) 

I have no family, poor social skills, introverted, little desire to interact with people in general but I'm so lost in this world I have to reach out for help.

I'm constantly being punished for trying to be a decent person and I can't take it anymore. I'm like an injured rabbit in a world of wolves. 

I'm burnt out, I don't belong in this world it's not for people like me. I don't know how to keep ""holding on"" for years on end waiting for it to be over. 

Sorry if this is too much for the sub, I'm not well versed in reddit. ","**Hello u/!**

This one might be rough for some 19 m,"I’ve been thinking about the financials of buying a gun won’t go into the specifics, but you could use your imagination. I’ve never had a girlfriend because of my unbelievably extreme anxiety literally canceled appointments with therapist because I don’t like meeting new people. It’s weird, huh? Extreme social anxiety yet the only thing I’ve ever wanted was a girlfriend? Can’t talk to women. And honestly, that’s just the start of my problems and that’s probably why I don’t have a girlfriend. I mean I’ve literally had several different girls ask me out yet my brain is just unable to act upon that correctly, I just tell them I’m not interested. There’s something wrong with me. I don’t know how to fix it. I can’t even talk to a therapist and I’m dangerously close to the edge at this point.

The only thing that keeps me from doing so is my want. I want a genuine relationship with a woman more than anything, and im determined to build one and get over my fear. You need a therapist, im a firm believer that everyone needs a therapist to some extent, especially guys like us with our debilitating dispositions. || Also if you need to I’d suggest doing everything you can to get on medication, that should make talking to a therapist a lot easier.

Why do I feel so stupid when trying to improve myself?,"I struggle with quite severe treatment resistant depression and anxiety along with ADD. I’ve tried dozens of medications and a few therapists and nothing has worked. Everyone around me is trying to give me tips and help. They say I need to try and think positively, look for the good in things and have gratitude for what I do have. I’ve also heard a lot about meditation and deep breathing/mindfulness being a huge help.

My problem is that I literally can’t get myself to do these things. The second I try and meditate to calm myself down or try to show gratitude I end up getting more angry and just feel like an idiot the whole time. I also have developed pretty bad anger issues recently (probably due to my other mental health stuff) which has made it even harder. The voice in my head is just constantly screaming at me that this is pointless and I’m an idiot whenever I try and do anything positive.

It doesn’t just stop with me either. Now whenever someone else tries to help me in any way I get very angry at them. I’ve cut myself off from mostly everything bc of this bc I grew to despise them. It’s a big reason why therapy doesn’t really work for me either. I feel like they are talking down to me and nothing can make me shake that feeling. It’s like I’m allergic to positivity. I don’t know what to do about this.

TLDR: whenever I try and be positive or even just neutral I become angry and can stop thinking about how stupid I am. When meditating my inner monologue is screaming at me how pathetic and stupid I am. Has anyone dealt with this?","Sometimes being positive feels alien and this can deter us. But the reality is not to focus on positivity or negativity but to focus on reality. It may be more beneficial, if you really want to learn meditation to try and tolerate that voice that tells you those things. Meditation is about hearing the thoughts, sensations and urges but not acting nor judging them. It is easy to react and become angered from them. It is what the inner critic does. The point is to keep engaging in sitting and hearing without action. That is if you truly want to learn meditation. Not what western culture has turned it into. It took me several years to get to a point where I could achieve just a half hour of ""success"" because meditation is about not doing. Observing but not reacting. Noticing the feeling of anger and trying not to let it consume you. And if you find it does, even a little, not judging your progress. Rather, allowing growth. It is normal. I feel cringe telling myself positive affirmations all the time, but different things work for different people. The more you use something the better you get at it, assuming you have the right fundamentals. || Idk why I didn’t think of the word cringe but that’s the perfect way to describe it. Positivity feels like nails on a chalkboard to me. It’s so bad that self harming is significantly easier for me to get my emotions under control compared to positive self talk and meditation. Also I forgot to mention that even reading has the same effect. Just trying to sit down and read a book feels excruciating.

I just got a new book bc I want to read more in hopes that it’ll improve my life. But I couldn’t even get through the first page before I had to stop because of how stupid I felt || the concepts and exercises can be a really helpful experience, it helps to adopt at least a foreword thinking mindset. Ask yourself, not how do I want this book to help me, but how can I help myself with this book? And what do I want a specific area of my life to look like when I am well on my way in this process. Rather than ""improving you"" self help books might help you think in a different way. Whether that is a better way, it depends on how it is applied. || That feeling and those specific words are a judgement that was put on you by someone, that’s not coming from you, that’s not your voice screaming at you. Find out where it came from and give it back to him, her, them. If you don’t clear your junk out, you don’t have room for the good stuff you want to keep. || Sorry I should’ve made this clear but I’m not trying to read self help books, I’m just trying to read in general. I even chose a kind of depressing genre (cosmic horror) to try to make it easier and more enjoyable for myself but I still couldn’t get past the first page even after 3 attempts. I feel like a physically can’t do anything || Try short stories, and if that seems too much, take a look at the r/WritingPrompts subreddit, there are some very short interesting stories to read there. Reading doesn't have to come from books. There are also a lot of other places where people will write about many things, eventually work yourself up to reading collections of short stories, one at a time or even just a few paragraphs. And it does seem silly to make it this miniscule, but that is because it is. However, if you keep increasing the duration, you will improve. We are often our own worst critics. We stand in our own way, We don't give ourselves permission to make mistakes. If reading a book is really important to you, you will come back to it. I have untreated ADD as well, and it is often challenging for me to read novels because other things win my attention. I have to really force myself to do what I am trying to accomplish.",1753753927.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbyz81/why_do_i_feel_so_stupid_when_trying_to_improve/,mentalhealth

"I’m stuck and could use some support. Injury, grief, burned out, and feeling lost","TL;DR: Grieving my dad (euthanasia, Nov '25), ended a relationship due to drug use (Jan), recently got injured (wrist + old glute issue), lost all physical outlets that gave me energy (climbing, swimming, walking, carving). Can't be the playful aunt I love to be. In the middle of a house purchase and work promotion. Stuck, drained, don’t know how to get back on my feet.

It’s not easy for me to ask for help, but dear Reddit, I think I need some.

The past year has been really tough. In November 2025, my father passed away through euthanasia after a long fight with cancer. Around the same time, I was trying to save my relationship after confronting my partner in September about his drug use (a suspicion I had been carrying for a long time). I ended the relationship this January. The damage was just too great.

Since then, it’s been a journey with ups and deep downs, but I started to feel like I was slowly crawling my way out of it. Until last week.

I’m a passionate climber. It gives me energy and purpose. Lately, I was doing really well, I swam in the sea several mornings a week, loved going for walks, and enjoyed woodworking (especially carving). But last week I injured my dominant wrist (which makes climbing, swimming, and carving off-limits), and an old glute injury flared up, making walking uncomfortable too. Suddenly, everything that gave me energy feels impossible.

On top of that, I have a maybe not-so-healthy relationship with my body and food. I eat clean and don’t binge, but food brings me comfort, and I’m scared that with this lack of movement, I’ll gain weight, lose muscle and feel even worse in my body.

I can’t be the playful, active aunt I usually am. I have a sweet nephew and niece, and I used to roughhouse with my nephew and cuddle and bottle-feed my baby niece, change diapers, the whole thing. Now I can’t do any of that in the way I love to.

I’m afraid I’m carrying trust issues into the rest of my life. After my last relationship (after all the lies and the gaslighting) I find myself more suspicious, more guarded. Not just with potential partners, but with friends, coworkers, even family. I hate that it’s changed how I look at people. I don’t want to live in defense mode, but I don’t know how to let my guard down again.

I’m also in the middle of buying a house and just got promoted at work. Which sounds great, but I’m still doing parts of my old job on top of the new responsibilities. Everything feels like too much, yet also like I’m wasting time I’ll never get back. Especially now that it’s summer in the Netherlands (a season that never lasts long).

Time with people, even loved ones, no longer brings me energy. I used to recharge with them, but now I just feel irritated and drained. It’s like I’ve run out of internal battery. At the same time, it feels like I'm letting down every person that is close to me.

I don’t know what I need to get out of this loop. I feel completely stuck, and I hope someone out there might recognize some of this and offer whatever it is I’m looking for, even if I don’t quite know what that is yet.",,1753766106.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc2wta/im_stuck_and_could_use_some_support_injury_grief/,mentalhealth
Not urgent but I feel like no one understands me,"I know literally everyone says that but here’s my situation, it’s not all of it but just the parts I was able to type out in a few minutes 

I work my ass off everyday in the gym trying to become special forces in the navy but my routine brings no joy, I’m always disappointed in myself and my results, I try to talk to my dad about my issues but he tells me that since “I’m looking great” my training is working. I have a very good physique for 17 but I’ve looked the same physique wise, been the same strength, and have no extra leanness in the past 5-6 months, I recently decided to try and become a diver in the navy which is very hard training and I swim 1000-2000m everyday but my routine just really kills me, I drive 40 minutes to the gym for a workout that sucks and don’t each lunch till around 4-5pm, I Finnaly can “relax” at around 6 because I sit in the shower for 30-40minutes doing nothing. I really don’t enjoy my life right now and don’t know what to do. The only thing I’m alive for is training and I can’t even do that right, I don’t know what to do. I can’t even eat any food without feeling very ill and I have had no drive for hunger for almost a year now, the doctor says I’m fine because I’ve “gained mass” but I’ve been the same weight for months, I’ve got a “great” physique as everyone says but it doesn’t make me proud of myself, I think it’s ugly and I’m ugly. This is my first post on anything ever and I hope atleast someone sees it.","I’m sorry you’re having a hard time. In all honesty, it’s kind of hard to really know yourself at your age. But I can tell you that you’re doing a great job. I’ve very impressed with your dedication. I suppose we’d need to know what your nutrition looks like, but my first guess is that maybe you’re not getting enough protein? Also, you’re way too hard on yourself. I know you’re motivated, but you have a big goal and need to give yourself some grace. Do you still go to high school? I don’t know if you have a friend group or not, but it sounds like you could use a little relaxation, some good sleep, and a day off :-) Are you waiting until you’re 18 to apply, or are your parents going to sign you up early? Is it possible to keep working out but put your goal to the side, just for a while, so that you can feel better mentally? Enjoying your life is the most important thing. I don’t know if you’d be happy starting off with just a regular military position, or maybe a regular job first, but these things are just kind of coming to my mind right now. What if you get in and you hate it? I just want to show you that there are options. Plus, I worked as a fed Agent and didn’t get the job until I was 36! And 37 was the cutoff. It was a great experience, but I didn’t love it. I retired early and realize now that I would have been happier in a less stressful position. Again, you’re doing great, even if no one else tells you! Hell, I feel the way you do right now at 51. Same feelings. || My nutrition is a major issue, I try to eat but something’s wrong with me that I can’t figure out and doctors just tell me I’m fine, I never feel hunger and when I try to eat I just feel ill and can’t eat it without almost vomiting, I try my best but I honestly don’t drink enough protein shakes as those are the only way I can get any nutrients in less than 30-45 min (that’s how long it takes me to eat a basic meal) but I just don’t think I work hard enough to gain anything",1753752461.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbyh19/not_urgent_but_i_feel_like_no_one_understands_me/,mentalhealth
Paranoia Reassurance needed,"Hi! It's not much here and not very important, just a small request and vent i guess. I've been very paranoid lately, to the point where I feel like an anxious toddler again. Everything frightens me and I know this is just an episode like it already was before, but still. I'm on vacation with my family now. I had a whole heavy type a panic attack on board of the plane during a flight because I was sure we'll crash; I had obsessive thoughts as we landed and lived here for a bit which was my health anxiety speaking; and now I have a full force paranoia in our room. We spend the second night in here and both times I've had absolutely terrible nightmares that involve cults and all sorts of demonic creepy stuff I guess. I wake up in cold sweat. The first time I managed to stay still and fall asleep short after, but now I literally had to sit down and look around, and in the dark of the room I see things again. Like how I feel that there's a creature with black body and white face standing nearby. I know that this all ain't real, just objects, but it still hurts my sick mind. And being this high alerted my mind comes up with such amazing ideas as some hotel personnel walking in our room any time soon to harm us etc. I suppose it all sounds like a nothingburger and some child's yap, but I've been dealing with all these feelings for a long time, and I'm kinda sure it'll stick to me until I'm somehow better. So then, like, what do I do? How do I stop my paranoia? How do I stop being scared all the time and how do I stop my brain from imagining things? I don't wanna see this black body white face guy anymore, and I don't wanna see endless nightmares, and I don't wanna have panic attacks and bizarre ideas. My parents don't exactly get me, so when I'm trying to help myself they usually yell at me and tell me to stop. So is now. I'm not sure if anyone will see this anyway, but if someone does and by luck you've also dealt with this - could you please give me tips? And if anyone could give me simple reassurance - that'd be more than just appreciated!

Nothing makes sense,"I’m surviving, not living, days are going by and I can barely get my memory straight right now. I often just stare off into space for no particular reason, infuriated over small things, lack the motivation to do anything and I can’t find meaning in anything. It’s all so empty and hollow, the only time I feel anything other than anger is when I’m reading or listening to music. I don’t know what I am, my mind shuts down or becomes frantic whenever I have to make a decision while I sit back with a constant feeling of detachment from everyday life. I don’t want to keep this up anymore, but my parents are forcing me into schedules that they like to pretend they give me a choice in making when I’m both too scared and in pieces to make decision on my own, and it’s not like they didn’t have an intended outcome in their minds and wouldn’t do everything to make it turn out their way. My life isn’t mine. How can I find a way to keep living with this","I may never be able to understand how you feel exactly, but I guess I was in the same boat as you at some point in life. You're a teen, right? Stuff you mentioned probably make you burnt out, the same way it went for me when I was around 16-19 years old. When you're pressured by expectations, standards of living, promises and stuff - you may start feeling like the situation is hopeless and you're doomed to live in the hell of a whirlwind of unhealthy feelings for the rest of your days. But it's not true. My path here was literally quitting everything and doing talks and compromises with my parents. By quitting I mean reasonable quitting, like, if you can you better graduate school because that's a necessary thing. Graduate it with Bs or your country's equivalent, and be okay with it. Quit sports or clubs or whatever that takes your energy and makes you unhappy. I, for example, quit preparation classes for top university. Punchline - I quit another university after year 1 as well. And I'm living alright. Do you have a dream job or something? Take a moment and draw a road map on how you wanna achieve that and what you need for it. For me it was game animation. I quit everything and presented a roadmap where I was planning to have a part-time job, and taking online courses that turned out to be cheaper in perspective than mentioned uni. We've had plenty of fights with parents, my mom wouldn't even talk to me for days. But you know? It's worth it. Don't be a jerk and instead be a dealer. Be sure in what plan you're proposing and show real progress. The key of living is to be happy after all. I know you said you have trouble deciding, I was there too, but it's normal to make mistakes. It's only important to pounce back and try to find a way around. Like how I got into that uni only to quit a year later lol! Your parents may be stricter, your situation may be a bit diffrent, but the main points stand - focus on what you truly want and present it to your parents properly, building separation and stuff",1753751987.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbyaxo/nothing_makes_sense/,mentalhealth
I have a lot of health things and always kinda hoped I was just a hypochondriac,"I’m not going to make this super long. I have pots, fibromyalgia, hypermobility, alopecia, an arrhythmia, anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, insomnia, an essential tremor, have had a 4 level cervical fusion, and transfusions and small surgeries that I woke up from and found out they were big surgeries. Everything always hurts and I can’t sit or stand or walk or lay without pain. I went to physical therapy today for my ‘degenerative disc disease’ and he asked if it was ok to record it on his phone and was like “I think you have MS and would like to show this to my colleagues.” 

Have an mri scheduled for the 13th and it’ll either confirm or show it’s just regular spinal issues that can be managed with surgery. I look fine. I’m 34yrs old and get complimented on my youthful appearance constantly, so people always think my “old person” stand and walk is exaggerated and for attention. I have a MASSIVE scar on the back of my neck and am grateful for it because I can be like “no-no, the pain is real.” After being dismissed for years. I came to terms with having a bad spine but friggin MS though? It runs in my family and my cousin took her life over it. I’m just afraid and hope this gets approved because hearing about similar situations or reading kind words would be really helpful right now 

Feel the need to edit and add that it’s all real","No advice, just wanted to tell you that I’m so sorry. The strength it takes to deal with all of this… you must be just exhausted. I’ve been through a lot of health struggles and cared for loved ones with chronic pain and other issues, so I won’t sugar coat it and tell you it’s going to be fine when we still don’t have answers. I will say that I know someone who was diagnosed with MS in his 30s, and although he has struggled a lot, he’s doing better right now. His meds are working well for him and he’s taking it one day at a time. It may be that some of your ailments are misdiagnosed and actually related to the (potential) MS, so it’s entirely possible that getting diagnosed and starting proper treatment could improve your quality of life some. Either way, I hope this MRI helps you find some answers and effective treatments. Try to get some good rest and let your support system help you whenever possible. Update us when you can/if you want to 😊 || It was like an out of body experience today when he was doing the tests. He made me do straight leg raises and I was like “what is this, whose body is this? Why can’t I control it?” Because my legs were shaking so violently. He touched my feet and my whole body jerked and moved my head so it was looking down and it jerked like that too. He was like “I’m not trying to scare you, but if you pee your pants, go to the er.” I’m trying to stay positive and think of it like “ok. If this is what it is, it is what it is- and they can treat it” and it sucks but it all sucks really bad now and regardless, isn’t going to get better on its own, but they might be able to make things a little better. I watched my cousin deteriorate and we were sad she was gone but didn’t judge her for her choice. It was in the early 00’s and medical technology has advanced, so it won’t be as bad. Idk.

What am I?,"I know there's some emptiness inside me and I wanted to know if I had a problem, I don't go into much specific detail but I'm obsessed with death and I always play looking for blood and pain, no one ever paid attention to that so I thought it was normal but I started watching some series about psychopathic people and ironically I identified myself, without going into too much detail but when I was irritated in the first year I stuck a pencil under the tongue of the person who irritated me, another time I grabbed someone's neck and threw it against the door (both children) and I don't regret it, and I usually manipulate people to get my hands dirty for me, silly things but without harming me, I'm very tolerant of pain, I only felt pain when I broke a bone but other than that nothing hurts, and they told me that I walk like a robot, like, all stiff with my arms stiff and my head up, and ironically my father is a sadistic piece of trash who only serves to hit women, he's already beaten me and beaten women too and I think that this sadism was his that I inherited. I can't feel love, like, I think a woman is beautiful but I don't love that woman, I don't think I even love my mother because I don't know what love is, and they say that cold people don't cry but it's inevitable, sometimes a tear falls unconsciously to lubricate the eyes, and I was diagnosed with ASD but I think it's wrong, and I don't know if they'll understand me but I mistreat animals more because I want to know what happens, and I wanted to know about humans too but I haven't done anything with humans.","Listen, I don’t like sugarcoating so I’m going to give it to you straight. You are fucked up. 

Everything about your way of thought and the way you perceive everything including yourself needs to change immediately. The you right now is a danger to everyone and everything around you. 

You absolutely need to begin taking steps towards psychiatric help or possibly even psychiatric institution. You have got to separate yourself from others until you are of sound mind. 

Please heed my advice before you hurt someone. || I agree with the other commenter, this kind of behaviour is definitely dangerous to others and you should seek help. Maybe the psychopaths we see in movies are always the violent kind, but it doesn't mean it has to be this way. There are ones that can function normally in society without endangering anyone || In this case, I have a psychologist because of this tea report but I don't tell him otherwise he might think I'm a psychotic and put me in a place where people are crazy, but when it comes to hurting people I don't do that because I control myself but I don't deny that I have an aggressive impulse but I handle it || As hard as it may be to come to terms with it, you may unfortunately be experiencing some form of psychosis. One example would be in your post you said you wanted “to know about humans too” in reference to mistreating animals, and that simply is not a sane state of thought. I wouldn’t like calling you crazy and so I definitely don’t want you to get to that point which is why I would heavily advise you to be completely open and honest with your psychologist about your true feelings, just as you are on this subreddit. Should they suggest some type of seclusion in order for you to be able to completely focus on aiding your mental health, it’s true that mental institutions get a bad rapport and sometimes for good reasons, but in your case you need to think outside of your own desires for the time being and instead think of the safety of others. 

I also understand that you think you have a control on your aggressive impulses, but the fact that you even have these impulses to begin with means that control is prone to slipping. Please for the sake of yourself and the sake of others around you seek immediate mental care.",1753765173.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc2mpk/what_am_i/,mentalhealth
Venting my lack of emotion/expression,"Sorry for the long post
   I (M) in my 20s throughout my entire life have never made a 100% true genuine connection with anyone in my life. Even friends I had for 10+ years I never truly opened up to. I never told them about people I liked or what music I enjoy, or even just have any deep emotional connection. In high school I was always ignored and treated like the guy that looks like im gonna off myself. I always look stone faced/resting bitch face. I can’t force a smile for a picture unless somebody makes me laugh. 
   I feel like I must have something wrong with me, whether some disorder or chemical imbalance in my brain. Ive never had therapy or anything like that. I used to enjoy hanging out with friends or playing video games when I was a kid, but now I only really enjoy anything on rare occasions. Ive never been in a relationship and anytime ive gotten close to any of my female friends. I feel like I should like them or should want to like them but never truly feel anything. Ive been in situations where any normal guy would initiate something but never even crosses my mind in the moment.
   I can’t vibe to music like most people, whether I like a song or even if im hammered I don’t feel the need or want to dance to music. Even something simple like nodding my head to a song I like. I can be with a group of friends where everyone is just “vibing” to a song or something and I just feel nothing. I wish I could express myself but I just don’t know how. Its not like I don’t enjoy music, I just can’t express it. One of the things that connects everyone in the world and I just can’t get an understanding of it. The only time I can express emotions is around dogs. 
    Ive never had social media, I deleted my facebook when I was in high school and never had insta or snap. Whenever I’m introduced to people its hard to make a connection when I can’t relate to anything and don’t understand the meme culture. From 15-22 I lost all of my friends from lack of connection. Ive never had a fall out or anything like that, we just grow apart.
    In the last few years I made one friend who took me under their wing out of luck and managed to grow some friends from there. An old childhood friend reconnected and invited me to be a roomate. I still havent been able to truly open up to these people depsite telling them pretty much everything about my life. 
    I want to better myself and have been putting in effort, but not enough. My goal is to build a balancdx life. Teach myself to cook, how to exercise etc… Ive never gonna to the gym and  am honestly scared to go with zero experience. I know most people with depression get recommended to get out of the house and hit the gym, but I just don’t think that will be enough for me. I don’t know where to begin or if I can ever learn how to act human. All of my thinking is just logical. People go to me for advice because all I know is to listen and give an unbiased opinion because ive never understood emotion.
   I have a decent paying job 80-100k, I enjoy the work and interact with different people of all cultures everyday. All of the conversation doesnt really get past “hows it going?” Or a head nod unless I see them all the time.
 I know this post was a messy unstructured one but I just needed to lay it out. What do I need to do to find myself?

Tldr: I (20s M) dont know how or cant express my emotions and feelings. I cant have deep connection with people. I dont know myself and want to improve my life.",,1753765151.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mc2mhk/venting_my_lack_of_emotionexpression/,mentalhealth

Today is my birthday and i wanna die,"Sorry this is long but I need to get some things off my chest.

Today i turn 23. I have a lot of suicidal thoughts everyday and i was gonna do it a couple of years ago but didn’t because i got scared.

I was bullied a lot through out my childhood especially that i was a fat kid and sometimes it came to touching in an uncomfortable way, i never told my parents because i was scared to tell them and just kept in and never told nobody in general because i find it extremely hard to tell someone i know.

I never had confidence in any way shape or form and it became much worse when my father passed away a month after my 17th birthday, he passed away due to cancer and he had it for two years and i saw a lot of bad stuff happen to my dad and it was traumatizing in a really bad way. 

At that point i started having suicidal thoughts and it was so difficult because i couldn’t tell my mom because she had enough going on with her and didn’t wanna bother her or my brother (I’m older than my brother) because he too was so depressed and i didn’t find it in my heart to tell him.

I still feel worthless and unloved even though my mom is the best and everything is going great but i still can’t find value in myself. Today when she got me a cake and also made another desert for me I just wanted to cry because i don’t feel like i deserve any of it.

I go to church every Sunday and pray but i don’t feel like I’m a good person to ask god for something so it’s really hard for me and i just feel like a statue standing or sitting in church without any emotion.

I just want this to end.. i want a hug from my father.","**Hello u/!**

"My girlfriend just broke up with me, or it seems so.","So, she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship right now and said we should just be friends. She mentioned that maybe there could be a chance for us to be together again if she's ready in the future, but I'm not sure if I should believe that.

We had already planned our future together, even though we're just teenagers, and now she left me. We were only together for a month and a half, but she already meant everything to me, and now I don't even have anyone else to talk to. My family doesn't care, and I don't really have any friends. All I ever wanted was to be with her — that was my goal in life. Without that, my life feels meaningless.

I don't have any hobbies, I'm afraid to talk to people, and I don't even know what kind of job I want to have in the future. I don't have any goal to live for. She told me that I should find someone better than her who would care about me, but I don't want anyone else — I want her and only her, and it hurts so much.

I hate myself so much. I hate that I care too much about everything, even about people who’ve hurt me the most. I hate that my life is just an endless loop of nothing. I hate being ugly. I hate living in this fucked-up world. I hate that no one cares about me. I hate that I'm afraid to die, and yet I still want to. Why can't I just be perfect? I hate that I've done nothing wrong, and life keeps kicking me while I'm already down. Why does everyone hate me so much? I literally have no one anymore. I hate having mommy issues and struggling with them.

Thank you for reading, I'm crying right now.
","About 6 months ago, I left my then girlfriend because I was catching feelings for someone else, and I didn't want to hurt her.
Turns out, I wasn't in the place to be with someone else ar that time, and everything ended in disaster. I was alone, like you feel right now, and no one, literally no one, to share it with about. Because no one cared. As much as I would have given anything for the people I cared about, no one would be there for me. I felt just as you do. 
So I really feel you right now. All I can tell you is... It is worth it. Life changes. You change. You learn to care, but for yourself. To stand up on your own. It's hard, it's horribly hard, and you have to grin your teeth and work extremely hard to care for yourself... And even then, you won't have the answers to all your questions. At least I don't, yet. But you'll realize it's okay not having everything figured it out. That it's okay to be imperfect. That it's okay to be yourself, a human being. Big hugs, stranger on the internet. May the darkness mantling your soul turn into a warm light some day. || It’s going to hurt. It’ll hurt a lot right now, honestly, and the worst part is you’re probably too hopeful to give up entirely either. I can’t tell you otherwise, because I know far too well that a month and a half is more than enough time to love with your entire heart, just for it be dropped in an instant and for your entire life to feel like a pit just opened underneath you.

You hope too much. You dream too much. You’re too kind. You love too much. You care too much. You understand yourself too much despite how much you want to control who you are.

None of those are inherently problematic, though. They’re beautiful things to have, even if I sometimes hate myself for them. But I’ve had to learn the one thing I really need to hate about myself.

You fear too much.

You can’t help it. You understand a lot about people, but not enough to have any certainty. I’d even say that you’re afraid of certainty in general, because you’re afraid of making the wrong decision. Afraid of missing out on the possibility of something even better for so many things. Afraid that whatever you decide won’t be good enough.

It’s tormenting though, to fear that much when you also hope so much. It’s legitimately maddening sometimes. It constantly hurts, and it threatens to rip you apart by pulling you from both ends.

Let yourself cry. Okay? You’re going to need to cry a lot. There’s a lot of feelings to get through. There’s a lot of frustrations to vent with everything that’s happened.

And lord, be careful. The closure you are looking for is going to be incredibly hard to find. I know this sort of person. When you hope too much and fear too much at the same time, getting dragged along is the *absolute* worst thing you can experience. While I thought being dropped would have broken me, it was the following year after that genuinely shattered me to pieces. In hindsight, I wish I’d just been cut off, because I never had the strength nor will to even consider it an option. I just wanted the person I thought I know. I didn’t care about anything else. I didn’t care about myself.

It’s going to be hard to think about wanting anything else right now. I know that. If I talked to myself 14 years ago, I’m still not sure I could convince myself to give up on that one specific dream of the person I held in my head. I didn’t want anything else, and I was existentially determined it was my one and only chance at happiness.

I’ve been through a lot. I’ve gotten far, far better than I used to be. Still not where I want to be, and far from perfect. I could never be perfect. I’m not a perfect person, and I’m the sort who just cannot get around who I am. Some things can change, I can learn, yes, but there’s a lot I will never be able to change. Things I don’t actually want to change, because if I had to change those things, everything that came from it would feel meaningless. So I still hope too much. I love too much. I care too much. All of those things, but the one thing I’m trying to do is not fear so much. I just want to be able to hope and dream without it hurting so much. I’ve had to ask myself so many times, what if I could just dream of what I want and imagine it, just for it to feel nice? Why does it have to hurt?

Anything like that will take time. It may not be the time to even think about right now, but I hope you can try to think on in time.

And again, please be careful. Try to be aware of the person you’re interacting with in the moment, and *do not* let the brilliant image of what you dreamed in the past replace who you’re looking at. I cannot tell you it’s impossible for things to work out because you won’t believe me. Which is all the more why I say to be careful. Be mindful. Try to be aware, and try as much as you can to not let desperate fear take over.

Can you try to do some of that? Whatever seems to make sense right now, and maybe anything that makes more sense later? I’ve been through a lot, and there’s a lot I would have wanted to tell myself those 14 years ago. To tell myself that it’d be okay, that even if everything doesn’t figure itself out, a lot will. I can’t know for certain what all I actually needed to hear back then, but I try my best at least. || You might think that being empathetic is a curse and your right 

But it also shows how much better of a person you are || I feel for you! It hurts like hell to be broken up with. And yeah, I would not count on you getting back together, as hard as that sounds to hear. It might happen, just don’t go around waiting for it.

But I would really advise you to seek out some hobbies. It’s not a good thing to put your whole existence on a romantic relationship. In fact that might be one of the reasons why she broke up with you. Few people want to be someone’s only purpose in life. As romantic as it might sound to be someone’s whole world, it puts a lot of pressure on you. And if she is leaning towards being avoidant that is enough to panic and run away. || Yeah I get that. Sorry bro, it hurts a lot. 

All those other future problems aren’t the biggest deal right now though, just focus on healing and recovering. Maybe see a therapist, look up healthy coping mechanisms, and anxiety/stress reduction tactics. || You were with her for 1 month... and you grew this attached, maybe thats the reason she left... you cant jump into ppl like that, sounds to me that you have to figure out your stuff before even trying a relantionship with anyone, you need to be good and doing stuff for yourself before commiting to others lil bro. || Your first relationship ending is always hard. You believe it will last forever and it doesn't. First relationships don't last in modern times, but that doesn't mean it won't hurt. You'll get over it, might not seem like it but as time goes by it will be less bad. || Thank you for your kind words.
I'm really afraid of being alone – and the truth is, I am alone. That’s why I became so attached to her. So many people in my life abandoned me when I needed them the most, even though I was always there for them when they needed me. No one ever truly appreciated me.

She was my first love – something I used to only dream about. I was so excited.
I don’t think I ever pressured her in any way. I really tried my best to be the best person I could be for her, and maybe that’s why it hurts so much now.
I’m not even sure if I should go back to her if she wanted me to. The relationship was often stressful. She would sometimes ignore me for an entire day or more, without any explanation. She made me feel guilty for caring about her – even when she was texting me about how bad she felt, and I was just worried about her every single day.

Still, she was the closest I’ve ever been to another person. Even though it hurt a lot, I kept trying to keep the relationship alive. I tried to push the pain aside just to make her happy – to make her feel loved and cherished, no matter what it cost me.

I’ll try not to let my fears take over, but sometimes it feels like I have no control over them.
I’m just so desperate for someone to care about me, to make me feel appreciated – and I can’t even feel that from my own family.
My mom is ashamed of me because I’m hurting myself and doing nothing all day. And my brother once told me that depression isn’t real and that he wouldn’t cry if I died.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. || Thank you, I really want to believe that I'm an good person || Thank you, she never really knew that I loved her so much that it became my reason to live, so I kinda doubt this was the thing that pushed her away || The resemblance is eerie, if I’m honest. Yes, it wasn’t all smooth during what was probably also a month and a half for me. I tried to not track the time, but the first week or two was especially great. Then she would sometimes just… stop responding sometimes. Wouldn’t hear from her until the next day, and while it bothered me some, I didn’t ever press for explanations or comment on it, but then she started feeling awful for reasons I can only guess today. She had a troubled past, a lot of difficulty with relationships, and probably with self-hatred that she never openly shared. It scared me at times, I didn’t want to assume the worst, but I’m still immensely patient, and immensely caring. I know I wasn’t overbearing in that time, and the panic and desperation didn’t start to kick in, slowly, until after the breakup.

You didn’t do anything wrong. Not a single thing. You didn’t actually care too much or do too much. Some people genuinely are deeply troubled in ways that even they don’t understand. I’m only barely starting to get how people like that work, but the one thing for certain is that it’s the worst type of person I could *ever* try to be with, no matter how much I want to help them and be patient with them. It usually starts with a period of intense feelings, but then it suddenly disappears for them. The person you see suddenly starts to look a lot different, and they may as well be a different person.

It’s hard to get over because yeah, I also had only dreamed about it for so long. Suddenly, it was there, it seemed great, and then just as suddenly, it was gone again. I just wanted for someone to understand me, to not feel so alone all the time surrounded by people who will never seem to understand me.

You’re still going to care about and appreciate people too. It’s a part of who you are. You’re the sort who often doesn’t even do it because it’s expected, you just… do it. It’s just the right thing. It’s meaningful, fulfilling even, when you can help someone who actually needs and deserves it.

And yes, the fear is hard to deal with. I still can’t keep it away all the time. Sometimes it will pop up, and I have to let it through and acknowledge it. Especially that fear of being alone. It’s good to recognize both that you want to try and that you won’t always be successful.

The last thing I’d say, as crazy as it probably sounds, is to try and keep hoping. Nothing in my life really felt like it started it getting better until I one day started flipping the goal from “not being alone” to “being happier”. Now, not being alone is on that list of things that’d make me happier, but so are a lot of other things. Some small, some not so small.

It changes my goals from trying to act out of fear to trying to act out of hope. I actually don’t act so desperate when I orient it like this. It’s another thing that is itself far from perfect, I fail to recognize it plenty of times, but I can at least say I’m better now. I know what I want better now, who I am, and what I’d actually need. It’s another idea that you can’t just jump straight into, but every now and then, it may be worth trying to consider the idea. Even if it feels silly in the moment.

Sometimes, I actually want to be alone now. It’s weird to me because how long I lived afraid of it. Not entirely alone either, I don’t want to be a literal recluse, but I do find myself strained around those who don’t appreciate me. I notice how they keep me from being happier solely because I feel an existential pressure to fit in with those that i’m around. The moment I started focusing on my own happiness, I realized how little joy I felt if I wasn’t being myself.

And, small tangent, but I despise your brother. Disappointed in your mother. More so on principle than anything else, I don’t actually know them, but what you mentioned is plenty enough. I didn’t really receive support from my family either, though much of the time it was either me hiding it far too well from them or them just simply having no idea what do and thus doing nothing. I hated the way they looked at me from very early on, when I could tell that they wanted to do something but didn’t know what. I wanted someone to just listen, though, and not look at me like an entirely different person afterwards.

This is just from what i’ve been through though. Everyone’s experiences will differ, and there’s still some things that hurt a lot to know I don’t have. Yet there’s a lot I still want to do. Things I want to learn, and things I hope to one day experience or try. Beauty I want to appreciate, whenever I can find it and have the space to see it. People I want to fine and trust, people who don’t abandon me the moment I do actually trust them. || You are a good person || Don’t be so sure. Girls can often feel that energy.",1753742954.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbuy54/my_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_or_it_seems_so/,mentalhealth
I need your opinion ?,"This is honestly weird, but I'm hoping if I reach out someone could help me. Since July of last year, I had my first panic attack, since then my life has been in shambles. It honestly felt like a complete shift and that the person I was before the panic attack was gone. I've trialed countless amounts of medications and nothing works. I've been diagnosed with panic disorder, ocd, depression, gad, ptsd and adhd. Daily panic attacks, debilitating anxiety, intrusive thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore. It's honestly overwhelming and scary. What did you guys take? Specifically what they tell me is my nervous system is stuck in fight or flight, essentially meaning I'm stuck in survival mode. But at the same time, I'm so sensitive to medications because I'm hypervigilant of my body sensations. I just wanted someone else's success story on medications who's been through what I'm going through right now. ","**Hello u/!**

Its hard being vulnerable with a complete stranger and makes sense that you would want to find a mental health provider that you could get to know. || Thats a big part of why i want to commit myself this time if i go to the ward... last time i went i was to scared and was committed.. with at least the somewhat control you get as a self committed person.. i could at least test the waters with people and see about medications i could research more and get in cont a ct with therapists that could help... but even then missing 1-2 weeks of work is extremelt... costly.... || Yeah, no joke.

"I believe i am becoming manic now, what to do?","Okay so im 18 years old, i recently got diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently (F3160) and for like 2 month i have felt pretty depressed like i couldnt get out of bed, literally stared at the wall for days, didnt eat, didnt shower, didnt brush teeth etc… 

And now all of a sudden around last night 23:30 / 11:30 in evening something changed and now im feeling awesome, full of energy, it feels like i could talk to people for hours, i want to go and socialize with people, i literally havent slept in like 23 hours and didnt eat anything since like 17 hours, but i dont feel hunger or tiredness, im like super euphoric, fully energized etc…

Help me what is going on? 

My dad has bipolar disorder if that counts, he takes medication for it, and hes either working full time and works everyday all 7 days of the week, or hes depressed af and he has been jobless because of his depression a few years ago.

I'm losing my sanity,"My anxiety is making me lose my sanity. I just can't take it anymore. I need help before it starts to get worse and worse. It's like I can hear voices screaming at me. I don't know what to do at this point, I doubt medication or talking to someone would cure me. I swear I'm going to wind up in a mental hospital one day, I always believed I would. Maybe I do need to or something. ","Gosh I’m sorry, it’s awful you feel so anxious. I’ve been there, and when your anxiety is that bad, everything seems hopeless. 

But I can assure you, that’s just the anxiety talking!!! Seeking out support through therapy and medication is definitely the first step. I hope you have the ability to get these. 

If not, just talking to anyone you trust is a great start. I know I’m an internet stranger, but I’m always open to messages! 

Also, if you can, try to find a new hobby that brings you joy. It can literally be walking, reading books at the library, or drawing (all things you can do for free or for very little money).

Does marijuana help your anxiety or make it worse?,"I used to have my medical card (it's not recreational in my state) and from where my anxiety was then to where it is now is insanely bad. It takes everything for me to be a member of society. I also increased the strength of medications, but my psychiatrist said that it shouldn't be affecting me the way that it is. Do I go back to it and hope that it helps, or am I waisting my time to invest in something with little beneficial outcomes? ","SSRIs have helped me the most. Lexapro to be exact. I used to be a daily smoker and I’d say it didn’t help me socially because I get paranoid but it was my thing that I did to unwind at the end of the day and it was something to look forward to. If you have morning anxiety smoking a small bowl can help with that. I think it is something that can make your anxiety worst if you become reliant on it but that’s with anything else. || Depends on how my anxiety is acting that day 🤣 || i don’t think it’s a smart way to combat anxiety || Somehow, both || It made my anxiety worse || It can be for certain people, definitely, it helped me but it doesn’t work for everyone. || Some strains provide more of a body high while others can give mental relaxation or other psychological effects. The amount matters like with many drugs an effective dose may be 20mg and be great but 30-40mg could be harmful. On top of these things, all medications can have different effects on different people. Some are more sensitive/resistant and some are allergic. I think the most useful source for information for you is the local dispensary. They will be able to recommend from their selection what best fits your situation and can relate feed back from their customers on the specific strains. It can all still boil down to how your body reacts but its a place to start. || Worse. I felt like everyone knew I was high as hell😂 I never felt like anyone was after me or anything but yeah || Hell yeah it helps!! I pop a 500mg (smoke shop shitty) gummy and I'm good for hours. When I get the chocolate bar (25 mg per piece)...that gets me good and relaxed lol. That's homemade shit.

The only time it made my anxiety worse is when I was first getting used to it. I took too much (35 mg of smoke shop gummy) and greened the fuck out. I had no tolerance and that was literally the first time I'd tried it lol. Fun times...how innocent I was back then lol. I don't get super stoned too often. I like it just a little bit more than high and I'm good.☺️ || It use to help me, then I moved across the country and it isn’t legal where I live so I stopped for a long time. Smoked once with my ex bf and it actually made my anxiety worse so I never smoked again. || Depends on the day and method. Sometimes edibles give me full on anxious break downs, head between my knees. My carts occasionally make me overthink on bad days, but I’m usually chiller on those || Depends on who you are || Gabapentin is great. || Edibles help me tons but I can't keep up with the cost. || Depends on the strain. Some mellow me right out and others increase the anxious thoughts. || Made my anxiety MUCH worse. || It depends on the person. It makes mine worse. || I’m a bit confused with your question.  Are you saying you are now self medicating and also taking prescription medication at the same time?  Does your Dr. know you are doing this?  Like I say I’m not sure what your situation is because of the way you’ve written it, but if you’re smoking pot while you’re on medication you’ll never know if your meds are working properly or if you need adjustments or even new medications.  How will your Dr. know?  If you have anxiety issues why mix pot with medicine.  Fix your anxiety first then if you feel the need, start slowly with pot to see how you are affected.  If you can’t lay off the pot long enough to find the proper treatment for your anxiety, then you have two problems.  Marijuana shouldn’t be used while you are being treated for any mental illness. || I think I’ve got it now.  You used to smoke pot but haven’t for over a year.  In that time your anxiety has gotten worse despite the increases in your medication.  Have you discussed with your psychiatrist the possibility of changing medication?  When you asked if marijuana helps or makes our anxiety worse I assumed you were thinking about using marijuana again, which would be anti productive if you are relying on your psychiatrist to help you reduce your anxiety, as all psychiatrists are aware that doing drugs whether it be marijuana or alcohol or any thing else, affects your mental state.  My psychiatrist wouldn’t waste his time on me if he thought I was using marijuana.  To answer your original question, using marijuana makes my anxiety worse. || Lexapro was actually the best medication for me as well. I started to get in a really low spot, though, and my doctor put me on desvanlafaxine instead. Sometimes, I wonder if it would be helping me again.",1753748007.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwvdq/does_marijuana_help_your_anxiety_or_make_it_worse/,mentalhealth

nothing has felt okay for a decade,"trigger warning: thoughts of self-exit

Hi, this is my first time posting on Reddit. Forgive me if there is an issue with my format. I have tried to be open with others about my struggles however I feel that what I am going through is too much to fully dump onto my friends. To start, a bit about me. I have experienced mental health struggles since the age of 11, however I have never been formally diagnosed. I believe I was experiencing symptoms of either OCD or severe anxiety due to recurrent intrusive thoughts about my religion at the time. As I grew older, toxic friendships and the combination of heavy academics exacerbated my symptoms. I have always been extremely anxious, and sensitive. I attempted to go to therapy, however due to insurance I was only allowed one session a month, which was way too little. Then my therapist stopped contacting me and did not let me know why. This was when I was about 17. I have tried going to school counselors however did not feel that I could be completely open with them since I was at an academically rigorous school that was known to expel you if you showed that you needed ""too much support"". I have a lot of imposter syndrome, and low self esteem. I did not believe I deserved help for a long time but recently I cannot handle this anymore on my own. I constantly break down, wishing for death passively. I wish I would die, in a painless way because I am too cowardly. I lose sleep because of how intense the anxiety gets and no amount of me telling myself that things will be okay and that I am doing better than I think can soothe me. I feel foggy brained and unable to complete work tasks in a timely manner. It is beginning to affect my processing speed and memory. I wanted to ""deal with it on my own"" and tell myself all the time that my problems aren't bad enough to do anything about it. I am now about to start my senior year of college and I feel immense grief, that my life has never felt okay. I feel absolutely helpless and alone. I know other people go through things much worse than me, and I feel worse knowing that as it is something people have said to dismiss me. I often question myself on whether or not I have autism or ADHD (I have neurodivergent siblings). For the first time in my life I do not feel like I can keep masking my difficulties and pretend to be high functioning when I am not. Please, if anyone is going through the same it would help me greatly to know I am not alone. I feel like my anxiety and depression are eating me alive","**Hello u/!**

i stopped making an effort,"Maybe my mom was right that I’m being too lazy, and my friend is also right that I’m just uninterested in class. I keep putting off work *very* frequently and only doing them until last minute. I get sidetracked too easily—and the only way I could stay on track is if my friend is on top of work, which I then follow through. I guess that makes me dependent too if I had to rely on someone else. 

One of my earlier classes, the one in which I’m taking with a friend, my grade is pretty decent right now. If not better, the topics are easy to understand. Which makes it fun compared to other classes such as chemistry or physics. I guess professors are also a factor because my math professor right now is easy to follow along as opposed to my physics professor(I dropped out of that course because it wasn’t easy but she was also kind of difficult to interact with, not gonna lie). 

I’m not sure why I do this either. I’m close to failing my current class soon only because I’m unsatisfied with my work too, BUT I also just can’t seem to do it either. The progress may be perfect, but I fear that the final product is not as perfect in my eyes. So I just don’t do it (until I actually have to).

A previous class I also took together with physics was also rough. I think I did okay in the first two weeks until everyone was forced to take class at home for just one day. I got sidetracked and everything fell off ever since. 

In summary, I just give up in the end. I have tried a lot in the past, but now I don’t think I have the urgency anymore to salvage my grades, even given the chance.",,1753746312.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbw8lc/i_stopped_making_an_effort/,mentalhealth

It's simply too big for one person tackle. If I thought it would help even one person to comment defending them I would, but the nature of the problem is usually not the same as bullying irl. What I mean is, unlike bullying irl, participating in online communities where this kind of stuff happens is easily avoided. I say easy, and that's true from a strictly physical stand point, but I know not reading comments on YouTube or twitter for example can be hard for a lot of people. There are a lot of reason for this, but those reasons are what needs to be addressed instead of getting yourself involved directly which is going to affect your own mental health adversely.

Very obsessive behaviour and I need help.,"If you struggle with body image and self confidence, please, please do not read this because it might influence unhealthy ideas.
For those of you that do read this, I know what I am doing is very sick and toxic, and I am aware it is. Please don’t judge me, I just want some advice on how to stop.

I will screenshot close up shots of my face and ask a looksmaxing app to honestly rate my face from 1-10. If I don’t get the score I want, I keep putting in different pictures and keep asking it the same thing until it gives me a rating I like. I can’t stop gathering images of my face and doing this. When I don’t get a rating I like I feel a pit in my stomach, but when I do get a rating I like, I get euphoric and it is hard to stop, like an addiction. I have to keep doing it until I get consistent ratings I am satisfied with, but it seems like no matter how much I do it I still don’t feel good enough. If I delete the app, I will just go on safari and do it there. It’s even gotten to the point where I put other women’s faces in that I went to school with that I always thought were the prettiest and made me look ugly, so that I can compare myself to them. 

This is what goes on in my mind all day. I cannot enjoy the present because this is what’s on my mind a lot. When I go in public, I think anyone that encounters me only sees me as what the app rated me and it makes me feel uncomfortable being perceived.

Conservatives destroyed my mental health And I would like to get rid of that.,"MAGA ideology on twitter has done a lot of damage to my mental health, because I feel that I was indoctrinated with their ideology They taught me: Black = woke , strong female = woke , LGBT = woke , unattractive woman = woke , etc And I would like to get rid of that and be a respectful person to everyone, In fact, I thought we were allies because we had common interests like: Hating Ironheart , Snow white live action,star wars acolyte But then they started insulting Mexicans and brown-skinned people, and I am a 22-year-old Mexican, Brown and bisexual So I told them that I realized that they destroyed my mental health because of their stupid ideology and they just blocked me. And it hurts me emotionally because I also suffered bans on Reddit for bad comments in several LGBT subreddits and I feel sorry but they don't want to unban me so I feel like the LGBT community and anti woke community hates me. (By the way, I have autism)  

My mental health is destroyed because every time I log on to Twitter, I get headaches, and I have to take pills for that.","I get it because there's apparently a thing called an alt-right pipeline. There appears to be a lot of conservative influencers compared to liberal ones. Just start looking at things about both sides and stuff. Definitely don't put yourself in like an echo chamber. Research things about different topics instead of listening to others in general. Twitter is a hot spot for conservatives I noticed. I really would limit Twitter if you can, but just be careful with any media in general. It's easy to get sucked into a negative mindset especially when it comes to political topics. || my advice is, touch grass. I was in the right wing pipeline as a teenager to an early adult until I started going out. and I met all kinds of people, people of different races/ethnicities/genders/sexualities etc. and they were all really cool and just normal people like me dealing with the same shit I dealt with. you'll find a much stronger sense of community with the odd folks you meet in your area than you ever will with weirdos online who give way too much of a fuck about characters no longer being the same skin color as them || Ok so 
First, Wokeness was originally started in the Black community. It's meant to encourage people to pay attention to the way people attempt to excuse things like racism, colorism, sexism etc.  As opposed to keeping your eyes closed to bad things happening around you, stay ""woke"". Right wing media have warped the definition of it. If you ultimately want equal rights for everyone, you believe in ""woke ideology"". Wanting people to be treated fairly is pushback against a closed minded system that seeks to treat people unfairly.  Aka, woke. 
Second, why do you have an issue with Ironheart? She was an original Black character. IronMan has had several sidekicks/kid characters he's associated with. Do you also dislike Harley, or Peter? There's very few central Black marvel characters. Yes, even including Wakandan characters,  because they as a whole rarely show up outside of their own issues. Ironheart is still not a central main Black character. She has like what? 2 runs? 
Third, with the other ""woke media "" you don't like, conservatives pretended to state things as fact while leaving no room to consider other facts. Yes, I think it makes sense to have a pale Snow White. But Rachel Zegler is racially majority white. Many people ignored this to hurl racism at her, instead of asking the more relevant question: why does Disney keep making a bunch of live action remakes no one asked for? Leftists defended the movie casting not because we desperately needed Rachel as Snow White, but because a lot of the criticisms were in bad faith, encouraging anti Latino, racist jokes and insults. Her initial pr run was cringey, but ultimately she said what she was clearly told to say, as the other people on the project said the same thing. Disney wants to pretend to be progressive while actively siding with conservatives in buisness deals. They set up their young actors of color in roles they would be foolish to refuse, both because of the money and because it hopefully gets their foot in the door, and then leaves them to deal with the fallout. 
Wanting to learn is always encouraged, but it's important to understand you aren't automatically owed forgiveness. || 1. It seems like you've identified Twitter as being harmful for you. That's an important realization, and I'd go further: figure out how to use it in a way that isn't harmful, or figure out how not to use it. If you can't do that on your own, therapy might help, or even your friends/family. 

2. Create a new reddit account and start from scratch (obligatory ""don't violate terms of use"" warning). If you're different now and act differently, people on reddit will only judge you for who you are now, not who you used to be. || Hate is cheap, and far too many people are cashing in on that. The cults will get you so stirred up about who to hate, and keep feeding you more reasons why. They love it because it shuts off your higher reasoning, makes you easy to manipulate. 

You want to be better? Focus on what brings you joy, love, peace. Seek out things that make you and others happy. Volunteer--it's extremely hard to hate anyone while serving them altruistically. 

You can even still dislike things, just don't go so far as to hate it. I thought Ironheart was good, but not great. But don't spend time hating it, just move on to better things. || Have you maybe ever tried....not going on twitter? || Just try to be positive and open-minded bud. Sounds like you're on a good path so far. It's hard to change, good on you for trying. || I'm an autistic/schizophrenia conservative. Let's get a bit outta the way. You were a shit person. Maga is basically a cult at this point. Being shitty while in a cult doesn't change the shitty behavior. Conservative beliefs were never meant to be racist or anti-woke, let alone so pro-rich. It is supposed to be the idea of justice and liberty for ALL. We meant that pledge when we were saying it. I remember we used to disagree with a couple things, like college being affordable vs free. Similar for housing. Conservative ideas are supposed to be that of a free but fair market that anyone can make it in. The Conservative side has been taken over by these biligerent racists and homophobes and we should hold ourselves and them especially accountable. All that outta the way though. You need to show genuine change and reflection. Make efforts to be the person you want to be, in silence too. Not just publicly. I remember reading one time about how the change we do in our hearts in the quiet of our homes can be seen by those around us. Don't remember where I read that though. It's important to detach from those cultist ideologies and work on being better. Remember, none of your fellows are typically the reason life is bad. That's mostly the government. Hatred is not the American way and you definitely see that now. A lot of media and social media are gonna push hateful rhetoric because it gets them views and money. You cannot buy into that. Twitter probably isn't the best spot to try and change your online algorithm but a change to that would be helpful. Block heavy Maga supporters. Interact with the democrats and the left side, liberals and all, as equals. Just because politicians lie to us and try to slander their colleagues to win elections doesn't mean we should fall to that level. Your algorithm will eventually change doing stuff like that. The best thing to say would be to be the light of change you wanna see. I'd say only after all that would I personally try to ask for forgiveness. Make it known, own your mistakes. Most folks from what I gather are good, well meaning folks. These times are tough and make people hostile against their normal nature. Remember, there are no enemies here. Good luck though, it's gonna be tough. || I would start with figuring what “woke” actually means and if there’s anything actually bad about it.
Like why is woke bad? Is everything bad you’ve been taught about it actually true? You still have this idea that anything “woke” is bad, but what is the actual problem? || Politics and news can be negative and depressing. I hope you get better. || Stop using twitter and step back a little from the internet in general. || Only one thing:

No matter what opinion or ""news coverage"" youll see - dont immediately think that it is true.

This is true for all narratives that you expose yourself to.

Think for yourself, and look for sources that you know have been truthful in the past.

Btw
Twitter has awful algorithms and it shows you weirdly isolated bubbles.
If i log into Twitter, 99% of my bubble is negative stuff - it fuxks with your mental if you lurk in it too much.

So basically, limit your Twitter usage (and social Media overall, youll thank me later) || Deleting the cesspool known as Twitter is the first big step into becoming the person YOU want to be. Social media is intentionally created to be addictive echo chamber and feed off of our hatred and anger for profit. Recognizing it is already huge progress for you! 

The more time you spend off social media the more you will realize that just about any sane person with an education sees these people as the complete degenerate insecure losers they are who have nothing better to do than spread their cancerous bigotry. 

EVERYONE is capable of escaping that and healing from whatever threw them into that pipeline in the first place, what matters is you keep moving forward and learning from those past experiences into becoming the person you know you can be. I believe in you, bro. || Well, congrats on escaping the alt right pipeline.

Fortunately, it's unlikely that an entire community hates you. But just cause you've had a change of heart doesn't mean people you may have hurt will welcome you with open arms. Better to change for your own happiness than the hope of their acceptance.

Also ...you may be a little too obsessed with hating media. Maybe you should focus on the things you like and connecting with people based on that instead of what you hate? You say you're autistic, and we're a passionate bunch about our interests, so there's gotta be something. || I genuinely think a good first step would be to limit or completely delete Twitter and Facebook. I have found those sites to be the slipperiest with alt right pipeline stuff || Go volunteer at a food distribution hub, get a sense for who is trying to survive in this society and why. It will be hard and emotionally taxing but its real and visceral and impactful. || I’d find a different community. It’s not like you knew them personally || I also feel them trying to make me take the final flight to Greenland. I know they want it when I can hear their thoughts but of course, I don’t let them know I can. You get it. 

I wish I could take some of the pain away. I can’t. I wish I could give you a heads up from insider knowledge of ICE if they could be after you But I do think we all need to collectively pool together because together, they don’t stand a chance. 

How can we actually get back at them? Well, I think I a good way to start is to analyze what they hate the most. Yup, you guess it, being gay. We all could literally decided to be gay in solidarity and they would be so disgusted and horrified at the images they would fantasize about our hot gay sex. They would largely go into either complete demoralization, or escape through insanity and fall to mental illness. I have decided to going the fight and have sworn off women. I got to be honest, I really don’t enjoy gay sex but I am forcing my self to do it and I will continue to do so until I love it. I am committed to protecting each and every one of you. So much so that I am letting things be done to parts of me I would have never wanted to have unless I felt this tremendous moral obligation. 

It only works if we all do it. So please don’t let me have gone gay in vain. I really am not enjoying receiving end but god damn it I will not allow the conservatives to win. I love you all. I’ll shelter you under my wing. || Unlearning harmful beliefs takes strength, and the fact that you’re trying shows real growth. It’s okay to feel hurt healing takes time, but you’re already on the right path. Keep going. || Can I just say that what you're feeling is understandable. I can imagine the stress. I just want to say that I'm proud of you for recognizing your emotions. Recognizing the BS. I think it would be a great idea to simply get away from these people. They are a bad influence. Always remember that just because you see someone post something. It doesn't mean it's true. I think it's best to take some time off. Even delete your account. This platform isn't healthy. Maybe find the joys of life and simple beauties. Talk to people. Keep moving forward. We all screw up time to time. It's all about growing and becoming a better person. I'm proud of you for recognizing the problems. Healing and improvement always starts by recognizing that you have a problem. 

My point is to ignore these creeps, live out your life. Go travel, find a hobby, talk to a variety of people, get curious, think small, I get how you feel. You're young and confused. Early adulthood is one of the most awkward periods in one's life and this MAGA shit isn't making anything easier. Social media too. Information overload and things. Remember to love yourself. You got a whole life ahead. The best way to undo bad behavior is to be nice.

Horrible panic attacks I used to have,"Fyi this was in like winter 2024-5

To keep this from being too long, the main context is that I was in a very dependent friendship where all my anxiety centered around my friends. I constantly thought they were going to die, that I said something wrong, or that they hated me. It got to the point where in classes with them I would zone out for long stretches of time just thinking about something I said or if they seemed like they were acting funny. This was occompanied by extreme self harted as well as sh and si that seemed neverending.

To get to the point, I would have world breaking panic attacks where my thoughts would rush and then I’d collapse and my eyes would roll back and I’d have intense flashbacks. 
 That was probably the worst my mental health had ever gotten and I don’t know how I survived.","**Hello u/!**

Saw a comment that said “Self-blaming didn’t work? What have I been doing all my life then?”,"Someone left this comment under my post here, and here’s what actually does help over time:

✅ Name your inner critic. Literally give it a name. ""Oh, there goes Boss Julio again, yelling about how I’m worthless."" It helps you create distance and realize those thoughts aren’t you.

✅ Replace blame with curiosity. Instead of “Why am I like this?”, try “What might be going on under this reaction?” Curiosity invites compassion. 

✅ Practice self-talk out loud. Not in your head. Out loud, like you’re talking to a friend who’s struggling. You’ll hear how harsh you really are — and you’ll want to change your tone.

✅ Write letters to yourself from a kinder voice. You don’t have to believe it fully at first. But the act itself rewires how your brain relates to you.

✅ Treat guilt like a signal, not a truth. Guilt isn’t always accurate. It’s often just a leftover emotion from childhood where we took responsibility for things we couldn’t control.

Honestly, healing starts not when we become someone else, but when we stop abandoning ourselves.",,1753743194.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbv1ek/saw_a_comment_that_said_selfblaming_didnt_work/,mentalhealth

Constant memory loss from minutes ago?,"Hello, I've had a bad memory for as long as I can remember. I was always forgetful and stuff, but I've noticed recently that it's gotten a little out of hand. It's not that I forget memories or plans, instead it's more a kind of short term memory issue.

I've had a lot of occurrences where my boyfriend told me something, like a news story or whatever and I see it a few days later and tell him about it and of course he is like ""I told you that like 2 days ago"" but I have NO memory of him telling me.
Or I'm telling him something, get distracted for a second and he tells me to continue, but I don't remember talking.

And it's not even like a blurred memory, it's literally as if it never happened. I have no recalling of that situation whatsoever. Nothing. It's simply as if my brain shut off in those moments, as if I wasn't there.

Like just now, what got me to make this post. My bf was talking to my cat and cuddled with her, showes me, I appearantly reacted and a few minutes later I looked over to him and was like ""wait kiwi (my cat) is here? When did she come up?""

"I need advice, please.","To start off, I am extremely and unimaginably embarrassed with all of this but I don’t know what else to do.
Since I was 19/20 (almost 25 now) I got put on benzos by my doctor. It has been benzos but just different names, but same class. Over the years I’ve been taking them on and off but just recently I’ve been taking way too much and for the last few months I would run out, go through withdrawals, get them filled again, and it would start over. This has been going on since December of last year, and I started taking so much because of things that were going on in my life that my brain deemed horribly stressful so I’d take one, or two, or five. 
It’s gotten to the point that this month, the 18th was the last time I took any. The last time I took a few, I had a horrible panic attack. I told (not my regular doctor I was speaking to this one in place of my regular one due to him being on vacation) my doctor what happened and that the panic attack was so bad I would like to be SAFLEY taken off, or weened off of them. He instead put me on a different benzo, that was a lot higher mg. I took his advice and took them and had a panic attack after (about an hour after taking) that was probably one of the worst ones I’ve ever had being medicated. This was the 22nd of this month. I spoke with him again the day after and he told me he didn’t know what I was talking about when I said I wanted to be weened off of them and gave me nothing to help, since the 22nd I’ve been having horrible withdrawal symptoms and the one that’s freaking me out is my neck has been tensing up so bad it hurts to move and I can’t sleep, when I can fall asleep I get maybe about at most 4 hours. I’ve been disassociating so bad and I haven’t been able to shower or bathe in anyway because it freaks me out. I haven’t been able to eat without getting extremely nauseous and then eventually vomiting, the only thing I can kind of keep down is crackers. I don’t know what to do. I’m so embarrassed and I feel disgusting. My psoriasis is getting so irritated in my hair on my scalp and my hair is matted and seems to be falling out a lot. Due to me constantly going through the cycle of withdrawals for months on and off I’ve lost so much weight and I feel gross, I’m unrecognizable in the mirror to myself. I haven’t been intimate with my boyfriend due to me feeling disgusting and being disgusting and also being disgusted in myself. I’m scared of dissociating so bad I can’t do anything for myself cause I don’t know how long I’ll be stuck in it for. I literally don’t know what to do but I just want things to be better and to get better and to change. I’ve talked to my therapist about all of this, and he always changes the subject to diets? I want to be able to be okay and be able to be intimate and to be able to look at myself without sobbing and to not feel violently ill. If you have any advice, anything will help. Thank you.","Hey dude this sounds like a really tough time, I can't suggest much when it comes to being weaned off meds tbh. Number one though is that you shouldn't feel embarrassed by this, everyone has lows and youre gonna be okay. Start with the little things, showering, food, and sleep. Showering wise maybe just try wiping down with a washcloth? Anything is better than nothing and itll make you feel a little better. You said your neck has been bothering you, I have severe joint pain and sometimes just a really warm washcloth or a heating pad if you have them helps alot. The heat may help with the tension and will also help you relax. Food is tough especially, id recommend something really light and start by eating small so you can tell if it will make you sick (apples are a good option or toast).
You dont have to try and fix everything at once, pick the option that feels the simplist and wont tax you. Start small today and worry about the big stuff later.",1753755622.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbzkg7/i_need_advice_please/,mentalhealth

I'm unattractive but not physically,"I (19f) have been insecure about my appearance for a long time. I've been rejected by guys a lot in the past which makes me afraid to make a move. I've been in a relationship three times during my entire life which isn't bad, but I don't get approached often by guys and men are often very mean to me for no particular reason and treat me different than they treat other women. I thought this was due to me being physically unattractive but I don't even look that bad and Im actually pretty average, I also often get DMs from men online but am rarely approached in person. I probably have some sort of neodivergency- I've never been diagnosed but I have tics since I was little, and those tics are very noticeable and uncontrollable, I can't control the tone of my voice so I always sound like I'm yelling, my body language is generally very weird, I need a lot of time to process everything that is going on around me, and I have a hard time noticing and understanding social constructs. I think my tics and my body language and my voice is what makes me unattractive no matter how great I look. Even if I do my makeup and dress up nicely, no one will look at me twice. I also have a hard time making friends and I barely get invited to hang out. I only have a few people that Im comfortable to text or invite to hang out because in the past, people found excuses not to hang out with me and just never told me directly that they didn't want to. I just think I'm too weird and don't know how to fix myself. I study at my dream college and I still feel like the biggest loser on earth. I also feel like I'll die alone and like no one is interested in me. I feel unloveable, as if I'm uncapable of being seen in any romantic or sexual sense. People all think that Im very confident and no one even has an idea how I feel about myself. Some people I know often make jokes about my appearance thinking I'll take it well because I seem confident on the outside but jokes like that actually damaged my self esteem a lot. I feel disgusting all the time. ","I think you should set boundaries about people you know joking about your appearance first. If this continues without you intervening, it will just feel more miserable.
A lot about you will change as time goes on. You're just 19. I hope you can find people who would love you just because of who you are.
Also don't push yourself to do some things just because of FOMO, I was hard on myself because I was thinking that I was late for a lot of things. || I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I can tell you’ve been holding a lot in, and that’s exhausting. You’re not broken or unloveable,  being different doesn’t take away your worth.

People might not always know how to understand you, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find the right people who do. You deserve to feel seen, supported, and loved, exactly as you are. Please don’t give up on that. You’re not alone. || Im so sorry you feel like that. i know how that feels, though. I wouldn't consider myself avrage haha whats self confidence right, haha 

Well, who cares what other people think? I know this is getting to you, but own it if people are being weird. Be weird back, be you except who you are and what you have. You want some one that wants you for you 
Not someone that takes things at face value 

Dont let people get u down. It's a horrible weight that only gets worse. The more you accept what people say, || Thank you so much for your advice. FOMO has been heavy on me.

Just venting...hope this is the right place for it,"I was married for 24 years and some change when my ex revealed he was cheating on me and I found out later he'd been cheating for awhile.  Six months at least...maybe/probably more.

He made it out like it was my fault because of something that happened a decade or so before. When I was 35 years old, I got pregnant with a very much wanted second child who I lost around 10 weeks of pregnancy.  That understandably sent me into a tailspin of grief and loss thr took me a long time to get over. 

Ex told me during a fight while we were separated that the cheating was my fault. That I neglected him during the period after the miscarriage. That I wasn't strong enough to stop being selfish and put my own grief aside to focus on him and his needs. 

I was still taking care of our son ( who was 10 at the time), taking care of the household chores, laundry, cooking and caring for our elderly cat while also working part time while he worked full time plus over time and he was gone quite a bit with his volunteer work ( he was a volunteer with a group that worked alongside the local fire dept as well as a local volunteer search and rescue geoup). 

I was a good wife...the best wife I knew how to be...for 24 freaking years. I gave everything to him and he says it was MY fault he cheated because of what happened after the miscarriage?  I don't see how it was my fault but...idk anymore. 

I was raised to be a good woman. To give and give and sacrifice til it hurts then dig deep and find a way to just give more. Taking time for yourself was selfish and a good woman ( again...the way I was raised) is never selfish. 

I gave him everything...sacrificed everything for him...my time, my body and my money ( he thought I was financially irresponsible and I had to ask for money if i wanted/needed anything). For 24 freaking years I gave him...or thought I did...everything he wanted. And if I disagreed or voiced an opinion he didn't like, I was called stupid and mansplained to on why I was wrong.

I loved this man. I was dedicated. I was loyal. The idea of cheating never crossed my mind because good women...good wives...don't cheat. Right?

What did I do wrong to make him cheat? I wish I knew. I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for whatever it is I did wrong to make him cheat.

I'm in a much healthier ( I feel like it is anyway) relationship now with a wonderful man who loves me very much. And I keep asking myself why he loves me when I'm clearly an awful partner if I couldn't make my ex stay loyal to me. I'm scared I'm gonna fuck this up too and I don't know if I could handle that. I love him ( my bf) so much. 

If yall made it this far, thanks for letting me get all of this out of my head. I appreciate it. Im just trying to process stuff that's been bothering me for awhile while I'm waiting for my bf to get home from work. I just...idk.

Work on learning to take no for an answer. Work.on accepting that he really wants you to leave him alone. Why do you keep bothering him when he wants you to leave him alone? He isn't going to change his mind. || When we were both teens? You’re still both teens. If you acknowledge you’re causing him distress then stop fucking bothering him. It’s not about what you would gain it’s about getting therapy because you’re obviously seeking attention from all sorts of angles. || The first thing I think you should do is try to apologize to your friend. Tell him that you are trying to work on yourself and are aware that this behavior is wrong. I think if you explain to him that him wanting to report you was sort of the wake-up call you needed, i think he will consider not reporting you, but you HAVE to stop bothering him in order for this to follow through. I think you pointing it out yourself means you have a lot of awareness that not a lot of people who do these kinds of things have. Do you harass this friend because of an attachment you might have to them? What is the reason? I think answering these questions can help you try to reason with him on why you keep harassing him online. I think talking to your parents could help a lot, especially if you do feel like you are obsessing over this friend. You should ask your mom to look into counseling resources or therapy. i know a friend who would keep trying to talk to her ex boyfriend years after the breakup and it got to a point where she started going to grief counseling sessions, and now she has moved on happily. You can do this girl, you’re so young and your emotions are going to be all over the place. Everything will be okay🫂 || im not doing it because i want to be his friend im doing it because i want attention and i want him to call me horrible stuff so i feel better about myself || i mean no legally in my country hes an adult thats why i said that and yeah im aware im seeking attention its painfully obvious and like yes i know im causing him destress but thats not making me stop || i mean i dont think its like a wake up call, hes threatened me with it since may and it hasn’t stopped me and i truly dont see myself stopping even with help i dont know and im obsessing over him because hes my only chance of communicating other than my mam since i dont have anybody else || i know theres free stuff around me but they are all either for people who arent teens or have a waiting list of like five years, i am not waiting five years for the slightest possibility of help i just cant and apparently its really really bad || but like whats the point in getting better for myself if nobodys gonna see it || If you ever want to have a loving healthy relationship with someone in the future you need to take this perfect opportunity to deal with rejection. Stop being so aggressive. It's disgusting. A healthy relationship would mean you discuss things that you both want in a relationship, not just what you want. || 18 is still a teen lol. No one recognizes 18 as an adult besides the government when you fuck up badly enough that they want to press charges against you. 

You need to seek therapy and stop depending on validation from others. Therapy therapy therapy. || Try and see if you can find other friends. You should join some communities and find people nearby to be friends with. For me personally, i got a job and found a whole new community of people to talk to there and I swear it changed my life. I think you need to find more friends and more people to talk to because i think depending and obsessing over 1 friend can be really overwhelming for that friend, and that is where it led to. I’ve been in your position before, where i would be almost begging for a friend to come back to me because i just love and miss them so much, but once i started hanging out with other people or kept myself busy, it was so much easier to move on from them. Is it something about the friend that makes you so drawn to them, or could it be that you don’t really have many other people to talk to? || i dont care if a relationship is healthy or not, i truly dont, all i care about is having someone to have a conversation with, its not about if they care about me i really couldn’t care less || and where do you expect me to get therapy money or find therapy near me, not everyone has money for therapy and the free shit does not work, trust me i know || i keep going to him because his friends will be mean to me and i like that since i like negative attention plus if i meet someone else im just gonna repeat the cycle of being their friend and then becoming obsessed and making every one of my waking thoughts about them, its happened everytime || but if i get better and dont become obsessive im not going to have anyone to be a better person to, i dont see anyone except my mam and im fine to her, i dont need to better myself to be better to her || Well, you are 15 (F) and that could could change if you get pregnant or decide to get married and have a family. For a baby, which can bring you great joy, you would want a healthy relationship with the father.

It sounds like you should talk to your mom, yes. || I’ve done free therapy before and actually found it awesome. My family is poor too, and there are resources available. The issue is how open minded you are and receptive. You need to be willing to make the changes yourself. 

Try to write down a list of all the negative things in your life that you need to change. Like stalking this boy. And then make a list about how to change that. You should also have a separate column about why you act and behave these ways. Don’t make excuses for yourself though. Making excuses won’t help you grow. || I feel like liking negative attention might just mean you like attention in general. I feel like you only like this negative attention and people being mean to you because you might find comfort in knowing that someone who you wanted to talk was talking to you, and that just happens to be what he says. I feel like another thing you might want to find the root of is obsessing over each friend you make. What makes you so drawn to your friends? And what made them start pulling away from you? Also, does this only happen with 1 person at a time, or do you obsess this way over multiple friends? (Just curious, so sorry if this language sounds mean or ignorant! I am using the word “obsessed” in the most literal way possible, not trying to invalidate your feelings or anything). || well firstly i dont like men so no chance of pregnancy, nobody in my family gets married so no i probably wont change",1753753740.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbywy6/do_i_tell_my_mother_i_might_get_reported_to_the/,mentalhealth
I started working out again :),"Hello, I wanted to share my little personal victory. After a good year and a half almost exclusively staying home shut in, with one of the toughest patch I had to go through, I finally had the motivation to work out again. I'm so proud of myself, because I'm taking much better care of myself. 

I'm autistic and depressed (for which I take antidepressants, and it tremendously helps), which make things harder sometimes, but over the past 3 months, slowly but surely, I managed to maintain good hygiene, eat clean, engage in hobbies, and now working out. It feels like I'm slowly getting better. I'm getting my spark back, and I like it a lot :)

Do you have your personal victories to share? No matter how small? Either way, you should be proud of yourself. ","Congratulations! This is a huge step. Make sure to not overwork yourself and stay hydrated! || I just got back into working out literally today too! It feels so amazing, I'm getting my spark and motivation back and I really have high hopes for the future with myself. I am so desperate to see what focusing on myself can change me into. 

Congratulations bro! I'm really happy and excited for you and so so proud of you! ❤ || Congrats buddy! I know how much that means ♥️👍👏",1753739881.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbtpi2/i_started_working_out_again/,mentalhealth
My mum's mental health is getting worse,"Idk if this is the right subreddit to post this, lets try.

I (19F) live together with my single mum. She is unemployed, I work fulltime to support us. She suffers from depression and anxiety since about 25 years, she was always on medication and used to go to therapy until about 10 years ago. In the past two years, her overall mental condition has worsened. She completely changed, she doesn't go out of the house or meet with friends anymore, she is quiet, she rarely talks to anyone except me, she refuses to take medication and overall is obviously depressed. 

About three months ago, her psychological symptoms became psychosomatic. She was feeling sick all the time, had high blood pressure, stopped eating, wasn't able to take any pills and ended up in hospital 7 times in the last couple of weeks. She got so weak that she is only able to move around in a wheelchair, she needs help showering and going to the toilet. Every time she gets out of the hospital she was feeling better for a couple of days before everything went back to 'normal'. We never got any specific diagnosis from doctors except a referral to a psychologial rehabilitation clinic, we are currently waiting for them to admit her (which can take weeks according to the doctors). 

In the meantime, we both suffer from her mental problems. I try everything to make her feel okay and loved. I cook her whatever she wants to eat (if she wants to eat). I make sure she take her pills, I take her for walks in the wheelchair, I comfort her ect. I know that I myself can't change her overall problems as they are way to bad, but I'm still wondering what I at home can do to support her better.

Visited home after years — I’m carrying a storm inside me,"I’ve been away for a couple of years, studying and working overseas, trying to build something meaningful. I recently came back home for a short visit… and it shattered me.

The people who raised me — distant relatives, older cousins, family friends — are quietly struggling. They’ve cut down to absolute basics: one milk packet a day, no newspaper, no simple comforts. Someone I deeply care about, who survived a serious health condition and is partially paralysed, is now driving long distances daily just to keep food on the table. It’s dangerous and heartbreaking. But they do it… because there’s no other option.

I lost my parents young. These people stepped up for me. And yet, while they’ve been living like this, I’ve been overseas — being lenient with my spending, treating myself for little wins, thinking I’m just living modestly. But now I realise… what I called ""treating myself"" could easily cover a few days of their basic needs.

Some of them are in debt. Others are stuck in low-paying jobs or dealing with health issues. I’m the only one in a position — or maybe with the potential — to help everyone. And now I can’t sleep at night. The guilt, the pressure… it’s overwhelming.

Can one person grow fast enough — emotionally, financially, mentally — to shoulder the weight of 8 or 10 lives?

If anyone’s been in this position… how did you hold yourself together and still move forward?",,1753752785.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbyl67/visited_home_after_years_im_carrying_a_storm/,mentalhealth
Some days are heavy but a light voice can make it easier,"I’m 19F and lately I’ve been trying to be more open about how I feel without overthinking it. Some days are quiet in a good way, and others just feel lonely. I’m not here looking for a therapist, just someone who gets it and knows how to keep things soft, supportive, and maybe even a little flirtatious when the time is right.

There’s something healing about playful conversation with someone who understands when to listen and when to distract. If you’re kind, open, and know how to be present in a conversation, that’s honestly more attractive than anything else.","**Hello u/!**

I (22 f) insulted my bf (23 m) while blackout drunk,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 years, but were best friends for 3.5 years prior to that. Our relationship started out amazing, as most do, and we tackled long distance (750 miles away) really well. About a year ago, my bf started a job in consulting (he was in college until 2024, I’ll be graduating in 2026) and since then has been working 60+ hours a week. It has undeniably taken a toll in our relationship. There’s a lack of consistent connection and passion, and I’ve been unhappy for a while. His working hours, while not directly his fault, are largely due to him taking on projects out of fearing for his job security. While I understand and respect this, the lack of overall connection we’ve been able to have due to his schedule and exhaustion has been a point of contention. About a week ago, I told him that I was feeling a little burnt out, and was unsure of how I felt towards remaining in a relationship with him. The core of our existence in each other’s lives is as best friends, and we’ve always strived to protect that. He’s been extremely supportive of my uncertainty and everything I could ask for. To provide a little further background, I’m half Salvadoran, and grew up speaking Spanish and being immersed in Latin American culture. However, as I’ve grown up, my mom stopped speaking Spanish to me and earlier this week, I realized that my maternal grandmother is losing her memory very rapidly. I’ve been devastated and mourning the loss of culture that will inevitably happen as my grandmother’s condition progresses, as my mother ages, etc. Meanwhile, a friend of a friend connected with me recently and I’ve been really excited/eager to befriend him because he’s Latine as well. On Saturday, I went out to a bar and got incredibly drunk. I have almost zero recollection of this, but I called my boyfriend at around 1 am and apparently insulted him, laughed at him, and made comments along the lines of “Why can’t you be brown like ____”. I am utterly disgusted with myself, horrified, and heartbroken. I am at a loss for words. When I woke up yesterday, though I didn’t remember what I had said, I immediately knew I had fucked up. I called my boyfriend and he didn’t elaborate much on what I told him on the phone, but he said “I’ve never been more offended and disgusted by you”. He’s asked for space, and I am doing so after I’ve of course profusely and sincerely apologized, and outlined actionable next steps for me (therapy, big break from drinking, reaching out to friends, etc). I know there’s not much else I can do from here on out. I am just truly and completely gutted at my behavior. I think I’m going to lose him, both as a partner and as a friend, and I hate myself.

TLDR; I got blackout drunk, called my boyfriend, and said some extremely damaging thing. I don’t remember pretty much any of it. Have been unhappy/struggling for a while, but working on it and moving through. Don’t know how to navigate this or live with myself going forward.","I'm very sorry you're going through this. I understand the space may feel suffocating if you're unsure of his next actions and it's absolutely valid to feel anxiety and guilt for your actions, as well as about the underlying stress in the relationship and grief over your grandmother and cultural connection.  
I think whats really important here, though, is that you've taken the next steps to addressing your recent actions. That shows self-awareness and accountability even while you're in distress. And you're right, there isn't much you can do in this moment beyond respecting his space and caring for yourself. It can definitely feel excruciating.   
For now, I'd recommend thinking about the actionable steps you've mentioned, such as therapy and a break from drinking. Regardless of how your boyfriend proceeds, please remember that one incident shouldn't define how much you are worth as a person, no matter how painful it feels right now. Please continue working on yourself and care for yourself.

Is life supposed be to feel weirdly melancholic all the time?,"I don’t know how to fight this feeling off. I could say a lot more about what I think might be causing it but 12months of therapy and the feeling persists.

I’d like it to stop, it makes it quite hard to enjoy being alive, even when things are “supposed” to be fine. I feel like I’ve tried to confront my anxieties and regrets, but it’s still there.

Muscle restlessness causing anxiety/anger?,"Looking for any ideas or similar experiences to help. 

Last year I began experiencing what I can best describe as “restless arms”? The closest feeling physically I can compare it to is when I had restless legs while pregnant. It’s a vibrating/ incessant need to move feeling in the muscles/nerves(?) of my hands and arms that is unbearable. It will suddenly come on it seems while I’m doing something that requires small hand movements (typing, writing, painting my nails) and sends me into a rage or sobbing breakdown because I can’t alleviate it no matter what. My physical reaction is to clench my fists and the muscles of my arms as hard as I can, when what I really want to do is punch through a wall just to get what it feels like is an excess of pent up energy or something in my arms. I have tried punching bags, working out, stretching, relaxation drinks such as magnesium, “devils lettuce” (I don’t know what I’m allowed to say here? 😂), I quit caffeine, warm baths and compresses, nerve relaxation lotion, I even quit my adderral for months in case it was the stimulant as a last resort(though it didn’t start when I started the adderal so I have no reason to believe that was it). I have broken things. I have screamed into a pillow. I have made myself bleed. Nothing helps. It prevents me from working because I can’t type. It ruins my day when all I want to do is paint my nails but I can’t, the instant I try to control it to apply polish I want to throw the polish across the room and scream. Typically what happens is I freak out and start sobbing because I feel so much rage that I know is not justified and I don’t know what else to do. And once my emotional outburst is complete the “issue” is gone. Maybe it’s unresolved emotional issues. If that’s the case it seems as if new anxiety medication would have helped. It didn’t. I have had a therapist for months. I have changed anxiety medications. Nothing. I have Xanax, nothing, it knocks me out cold so I no longer have to feel my arms but it doesn’t take away that feeling. 

Any ideas? ",,1753749714.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbxhh6/muscle_restlessness_causing_anxietyanger/,mentalhealth

"Extreme anxiety and depression from boyfriend’s porn usage and taste in women, is there a path forward without breaking up?","31F and my BF M37 of almost two years and I keep struggling with this one recurring issue related to 1) my body insecurities and 2) his ocasional porn usage.
To keep it extremely short, I was flat when we met and found porn in his phone of big tit women, and also racially diverse searches. I am white/hispanic and petite and he had searches of everything but my type. This affected me greatly and I got breast augmentation, which helped my self esteem but I keep chasing perfection without end because my boobs will never look like big natural ones, which is what he likes.
On top of this for over a year he had mild erectile disfunction and I associated it with me being flat or different from his porn searches and not turning him on, until he opened up about past drug abuse and porn addiction. He went to the dr and now is on Viagra, which has helped greatly. He swears his ED had nothing to do with me as he finds me very attractive.
He significantly cut his porn use but when I leave for work trips he does it and it gives me severe anxiety.
He says he can stop it but I know he just says that and never will fully quit. I asked myself what’s my boundary? Once a months twice a year? Never? And I have a hard time finding the answer because no amount of porn he watches seems ok to me but also I recognize most men will use it so wi don’t want to be alone the rest of my life chasing the impossible task of finding a men that does not want porn and checks all the other boxes. My BF. Heck’s all the boxes but this one.

I feel constantly insufficient, even though he reassures me. I know what he likes now and cannot get it out of my head (the models he searched for, the porn searches of big tit blondes and big tit Indian and black girls) and I am absolutely haunted to the point I don’t know I can ever let go of it. I keep thinking these things he likes and everything in my day to day they remind me of it gives me triggers that put me in a terrible mental space. A tv show, a person walking across from us in the street, even his tattoos. I am tired of being miserable.

What can I do?","Break up with him and can you please decenter men? You’re making me cringe. Not to be harsh, but let this radicalize you. I’ve been like you when I was 23. (I’m 26 for gods sake.

Has anyone successfully committed a loved one during a psychotic break? I’m desperate for guidance and words of encouragement.,"This is my second post about my brother (36M), and I’m growing more desperate. His behavior is increasingly erratic and delusional, and I genuinely believe he needs psychiatric help before something truly dangerous happens. Waiting it out is not working, and I’m terrified.

I’m hoping someone can guide me through the process of getting him placed on an involuntary hold or offer advice, encouragement, or personal experiences. I’d like to not feel so alone in this.

***Background:***

Two weeks ago, he began claiming he was drinking “bone marrow from ancient giants” (actually a vitamin powder), fasting because “the government is poisoning food,” and ranting about celebrities trafficking children through McDonald’s burgers. He believes vampires, demons, and conspiracies are real.

On 7/20, he came to my house at 2:30am demanding we purify spring water with crystals. He said he met a time traveler with a magical staff and traveled through seven dimensions. His delusions have shifted from spiritual to extreme Christian interpretations—he now believes God is revealing apocalyptic secrets.

The next day, my dad (who lives with him) said my brother lost his phone and wallet, later found over a mile away. He returned soaked, saying my dog chased away Hell Hounds. A neighbor saw him screaming at the dog to flee from demons. He now insists the dog is a human soul trapped in a dog’s body.

His symptoms worsen at night: he claims he moves the sun and moon, hears six voices, talks to God, and can make people disappear.

Yesterday, he forcibly took my gemstone collection (worth $500+), including pieces gifted from deceased loved ones, saying they were cursed and tried to burn them. When my dad intervened, my brother punched him and broke his glasses.

He believes my son (6) has a demon inside him and that my ""crystals"" (my gemstones I use to make jewlery and just use as decor), tarot cards (which were given to me by a deceased friend, I have never played with them or used them), and his ex-gf’s alleged curse have brought darkness into our home. He insists the world will end next Wednesday and that he will “come get us,” but we must leave everything behind. He swears he is not crazy, just awakened. I do not want to wait til then and see what happens when the world doesn't end or see if thinks it does.

He’s been sober for 10 years. I’m 7 years sober myself. Our dad searched the house and his truck, no paraphernalia. This doesn’t appear drug-related.

**Colorado Law:**

Under C.R.S. 27-65-105, someone can be placed on a 72-hour emergency psychiatric hold (M-1 hold) if they're a danger to themselves or others due to a mental health crisis. This can be initiated by law enforcement, a licensed physician, or a qualified mental health professional.

If more treatment is needed, C.R.S. 27-65-109 allows for short-term involuntary commitment, but that requires a court order and evidence of grave disability or continued danger.

**What I'm asking for:**

* Advice on how to initiate an M-1 hold safely
* What documentation or evidence helps
* Legal insights into protecting ourselves and ensuring his care
* Personal experiences: what helped, what didn’t
* Words of encouragement

I’ve contacted NAMI and gotten some guidance. But I’m scared. He has one of my dogs, knows my house codes (I don’t know how to change them!), has already hurt my dad, and can get very violent. I love him, but I need to protect my family.","1st- figure out how to change the house codes, 2nd- I’m not familiar with CO law, but call your local state dept of mental health, and/or probate court about the hold. In my state (sc), probate court initiates the hold after an appt with the state dept of mental health. If he refuses to come/comply, a deputy will come transport him. 3rd- I’m thinking of you and your family, this is such a difficult situation to be in. Please update us. || Idk the specific laws of your state. 

So call 911 this is an emergency 

So if its ok for you to tell us what drugs you and your brother took if its ok with you

Also has your family had any mental illness || Thank you so much for your comment. I really appreciate you laying out those steps, it gives me something concrete to hold on to while everything feels so chaotic. I’ll definitely look into changing the house codes as soon as I can, and I’ll reach out to the proper department here in Colorado. 

This is incredibly difficult, and I’m grateful to know I have people checking in. I’ll keep you posted as things unfold—thank you again for thinking of us. || My brother’s been smoking pot since he was 10. He started using harder drugs like heroin, meth, and coke in his mid-20s, actually after I did (he is 6 years older than me). I was using from around 14 to 22. He eventually quit the hard stuff around age 29, and hasn’t touched hallucinogens much, only tried shrooms twice, and he was always afraid of anything more intense and did not like the shrooms. That’s why I don’t think this current episode is drug-induced psychosis.

That said, he’s been smoking weed again recently but hasn’t for the last few days, I just started wondering if it could have been caused by the cannabis. Our family does have a history of mental health challenges: anxiety, depression, ADHD, addiction, and some generational trauma. But no one’s ever gone through a full psychotic break before, at least not that I’m aware of.

As for what to do next, I’m feeling torn. My brother’s really afraid of cops, so I worry that calling 911 could make things worse or push him into deeper paranoia. I’ve thought about just dropping the ball and requesting a mental health team to come out, but I don’t even know if they’d be able to do much if he refuses help. Part of me wonders if I should get the family together and try talking to him first, just to see if we can break through somehow before involving outside resources. But honestly, I don’t know what would be best at this point. || Call 911 and tell them about the specific situation
They probably know what there doing.

Canibise does have a history of a incredibly small chance for mental problems and with your familys history its more likely sadly.

I hope your brother gets better",1753735287.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbrr0d/has_anyone_successfully_committed_a_loved_one/,mentalhealth
Mental Survivor: The Fight You Don’t See,,,1753734890.0,2,https://youtube.com/shorts/3lizdrZWQhc?feature=share,mentalhealth
I'm so fucking tired of my inability to find love,"So for context, I'm a 16 year old autistic male, who has liked a total of 15 girls, confessed to 10, been rejected and or friend zoned by those ten, at this point I have developed a negative attitude towards myself and blame my inability to find a girlfriend on my looks and personality and not because I fall in love too easily and fall in love with girls outside of my 'league' (Not that I fully understand the league concept), I'm just so fucking tired of liking a girl and wanting to confess but being scared of fucking up my current relationship with them (if they're a friend of mine). My friends all say it'll happen one day and I'll find the one but yet at only 16 I feel like I shall live the rest of my life alone (when it comes to love), it also doesn't help that I over think everything about the person I like (mostly how they'd react if and when I confessed my feelings to them). Any advice would be appreciated. I also due to this then feel like I am undeserving of love and 'unworthy' of a girlfriend. (sorry for the rambling if you read all the way through this)","bb. you're 16. people are so shallow and immature at that age. it'll get easier as you get older. also, as an autistic person i confessed to upwards of 20 ppl in my life and all it took was one yes and we ended up married 2 years later. be frustrated be mad but remember- you're 16. it's not always great to be high school sweethearts because those relationships rarely survive the massive changes you both go through in college/adulthood || Man you’re so young. I’m 30 years old let me tell you even if go another 5 years you’ve still got PLENTY of time left. I’d focus on education, on a job. Put money away!! Hit the gym. Find hobbies and connect with friends. Sort out your wardrobe. Get a nice haircut. Get some nice aftershave. And it will come. || My most favorite person I ever dated is autistic. He was wonderful. I didn’t have my first real bf until I was almost 18. You’ll find someone eventually but don’t rush into it. || I'm 28M, also on the spectrum, my first girlfriend I had at 16 and is difficult I will not deny it but I will tell you, you need to try, for us is hard to make meaningful relationships, but if we delay it there are two things first we have more to lose and second is harder.

It's scary I know specially for us, but we can also be courageous, for me anime helped to inspire me and you know seeing all those heroes helped me to find some courage, but of course you may have someone IRL idk father, mother, friends, etc

And even more important than being courageous is to never stop trying, right now I'm a doctor so a lot of patient interactions, and I'm even called social by my friends, something like ""The other day when we were silent I said that if you were here you would be talking"" or ""You're the most outgoing"".

Of course I still have problems for example is still extremely awkward for me to be social (yes despite being labeled as outgoing), in parties I'm the one that don't dance (except for group dances so you know the ones I actually know the hmmm ""choreography"") and many many things.

Of course I've had meaningful relationships (only 3) and in 2 of them I asked, fearful and everything but it worked, the third is an exception after all she's the one that told me. And of course i had a lot of rejections and being friendzoned and everything (is not exclusive to us in the spectrum hahaha).

Why I'm telling you aaaaall this? Simple while you do confess and everything you are letting the rejection to affect you and you grow increasingly fearful, I understand is not easy nor pleasant but if you do want to have more friends, girlfriend or whatever you can only risk it and go for it, the fear never disappears, the disappointment, nervousness, but after a while you just learn from that and grow, and the next time is easier. || I guess that is one of my problems I was jealous of seeing all the happy high-school couples around me to understand that they probably won't last but thanks for reading my post and then giving me the 'advice' (not entirely sure what to call it so sorry if I come off as rude) || Thanks for the advice I'll make sure I try my hardest with these || Thanks for the advice || If it makes you feel any better, I didn't go on my first proper date until I was 20. || Build your life around making yourself strong, resilient, confident and wise. Trying to get into a relationship at this age is a terrible idea. Infatuation and interest in intimacy is completely normal for teenagers but fixating on finding love at 16 is reckless. Friendships, group hangouts, going out as friends as much as possible is how we learn to navigate interactions with fellow humans that eventually leads to deeper exclusive relationships. Confessing to 10 potential partners at 16 is too much, you’re coming on too strong. One on one scenarios are a high risk for failure. Get some friends who know some other friends of both sexes and socialize with a group and relax. Put the tiger in the cage. Too much intensity scares people away || If you want to talk or something feel free to send DM, just have some patience hahaha i can't always answer || Thanks mate",1753734578.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbrflz/im_so_fucking_tired_of_my_inability_to_find_love/,mentalhealth
I suffer from wanting to be different,"I think I get upset whenever this happens.
I feel upset because there was a business startup idea about making certain t shirts . I went to work wearing a T-shirt that matched the ones I wanted to make…. Then my new friend surprised me with a visit to the office where she used to work too. She loved the t shirt but then she told me she wanted to start a business and make ones like it…
I felt very bad because I felt like it wasn’t so known in my friend group. This friend thinks a lot like me and she sometimes chooses / does the same stuff as me  , I think,  unintentionally…


She now thinks she found the idea of her dreams and wants to start it as soon as possible and I told her I’ve wanted to do it for a while and searched for a place where I can learn and she tells me she wants me to send it to her.

I’m upset because I needed to go and learn something I thought was new to me and my group. Part of me wanted to feel special and known for doing something unique in this particular group. But now she keeps sending me and it’s stuck in her mind.


I don’t know if it’s an issue with me or if it’s okay to sometimes feel like wanting to feel a bit special somewhere… 
I also wanted to keep myself busy since I lost mom not so long ago and wanted to be passionate about something again. 

I regret wearing the t shirt …

I don’t want to lose her and I don’t know how I can go now that she wants to go too. She may be mad at me if she finds out I go alone. 


I want her to forget about it. I saved privately videos about some tutorials and thought it was private but she clearly saw these videos (the app recommended them to her) 


I feel so guilty for wanting to be special and I want this . There’s nothing else that I want to do. I was going to be happy about it…. 

What should I do? Should I go to the workshop alone and learn how to do it? It’s a very unique type of manufacturing…. Or should I go with her? But she expressed what she wanted to do and it’s exactly the same style…. 

I sent her the workshop page and sent her an account that sold the shoes I was wearing  too since she liked them too
But then I deleted the workshop page as I felt hesitant and worried…. I hope she didn’t read the message when I sent it…I’m was unable to know if she read the message before I delete it or not… but I delete it anyway. I felt like she was confused a abit 


I wish she’d forget about the whole thing. 

I have no problem if other people wanted to do something similar since I didn’t invent them but I just don’t like it sines it’s someone from my friend group that wants to do it ",,1753747697.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwr9u/i_suffer_from_wanting_to_be_different/,mentalhealth
I wanna remove myself from everyone's life even if I know I shouldn't,"I have a best friend, a boyfriend, some internet friends and my father, to wich I consider the nearest person to me and I want to simply disapear from their life. I don't have any problems with each of them, I just feel very exausted from things. I don't even dislike human interaction, it makes me happy to exchange words with strangers, even tho I get anxious and don't always know how to drive the conversation, but I have this strong desire to isolate myself from everyone and the only human interaction I would get would be throught the internet and I wouldn't become friend with anyone.

I also feel that my love for everyone around me is... Not very strong. Like I have rare moments where I strongly love someon like my friend, my father or my bf, but most of the time I just... don't care much ? I'm curentlt giving support to my besfriends who's going throught and rought time but I feel like I do it because it's my dutie as a friend, not because I love her. Same for talking with my discord friends or my bf... I just don't understand it.

I don't want to continue with my therapist.,"(18 female)
Although she's just doing her job, she helped me a lot and did some favors for me, and I can't really stop feeling guilty for trying to stop going there.
As for why I'm feeling this way, I highly think that it's quite complicated and wrong, I stopped my antidepressants (SSRI 50g) even while I'm not supposed to, I was only met with better appetite and mood in general, but that didn't come out of the blue.
I go to therapy because of social anxiety, built up depression, panick attacks, suicidal thoughts and active self harm and I guess more according to the diagnosis (I actually started doing self harm seriously after taking medications, which I can't completely explain why).
The reason why I started therapy was my abusive father, it was a recommendation from some sort of, I don't know exactly since it's highly related to my mother's divorce and her rights as someone who's been abused. (Which makes it harder for me to just stop therapy like that)  
I had a fight with my mother, since I decided that I should visit my friend in order to feel better because stress was hunting me nonstop even when my mother said no but then I was only met with hurtful words and got my money taken away from me. (My mother is not a bad person she's stressed as much as I am but that doesn't justify her actions and it doesn't justify my actions too). 
I ended up running away and cutting my wrist, then I started acting stubborn and started trying to stop a car to take me to the hospital, but I looked terrible and everyone was visibly scared from me, it's just that I wanted to see my therapist at that moment, later on my mother dealed with it. 
And to be honest after everything I started feeling terrible for what I've done, especially showing to that large amount of people with such terrible scene, that's when I stopped my meds, because at the hospital they suggested hospitalizing me in a mental health hospital saying that I'm a direct threat for myself and others, that did hurt me so much and knowing that still hurts, it makes me feel scared and unheard, it makes me think that no one is willing to listen to how I truly feel even while I can be considered actively suicidal I still think that I didn't cross that line and still deserve to be met with understanding rather than fear, I know how societies work but I still can't just accept it personally. 
I don't want to continue with my therapist anymore because I know that I'm going to be met with strict procedures if I tell her my story and I just want to be met with peace and some support so I can deal with it all by myself, not to just feel helpless. Now I personally don't know exactly how am I supposed to feel, what am I supposed to think about or if I deserve a second chance with myself, now I think that continuing therapy will just make me feel terrible about myself even while I know that my therapist did everything to help me through these last months i believe that as long as I'm feeling distressed and uncomfortable continuing sessions I have the right to stop.
I already sent my therapist an email telling her that I'm doing good and tried my best to make sure that she knows that I'm not willing to pursue. 
I need advice because even with all of this I don't know what am I supposed to do exactly, I'm not feeling at ease after all, I'm afraid that I might doing something wrong, I'm still afraid and I can't help it.","**Hello u/!**

does being with someone every day worsen emotional dependency?,"hi everyone so basically i've struggled with emotional dependency since i was born basically, and i have this very platonic friend i've become emotional dependent on. the thing is: she's a really good friend and knows i struggle with this, i just don't think she knows that im emotionally dependent on her. this summer we wanted to do a lot of things together and we've been spending almost every minute together, if not in person then texting. what's the problem then, you ask? i get jealous of her relationship with a mutual friend of ours and every time the three of us hang out i feel hurt bc my mind makes me think she likes my other friend much more than me, and if i feel like i'm not the most special friend to her then i get into a depressive state and i spiral. it's weird because i only see her as a friend, and i don't know if spending this much time with her has made me more obsessive or more reassured and secured of our friendship. in one hand i feel loved and cared for when we're alone together, but on the other hand whenever we're in a group setting it feels like she doesn't like me as much as i like her, and that's just because she's interacting with people other than me. i know that's fine and normal but i have this instant reaction where my brain sends a panic alert to my whole body and i just feel really sick and anxious. another example is something she said the other day. she invited me to a hang out with her friend and friends of that friend that she didn't know. i said i didn't know if i was really in the mood but i'd think about it, and then told her to tell me where it was when she found out, because if it was close to my house maybe i'd show up. she ended up not going but before realizing she wasn't going she didn't tell me where it was, almost as if she didn't want me to come. and then what she said was ""oh remember that one hang out i told u about the other day that i ended up notgoing? well i got a bit disappointed that my friend cancelled bc i wanted to meet new people to vary"" and it was like she stabbed me. she always says that she really likes hanging out with me but she'd also like to hang out with other people, and i get that bc i feel the same way, but it really hurts because it feels like she doesn't like me enough. my fear is that spending all this time with her made me feel like this, but if i don't spend this much time with her she'll  get disappointed bc we're not doing anything and then summer becomes boring and also i love spending time with her and the feeling of being reassured in general. what do yall think? sorry if this was a bit confusing",,1753746453.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbwahy/does_being_with_someone_every_day_worsen/,mentalhealth

Apathy and emptiness with depression. Nobody around me seems to fully grasp it.,"I'm just tired of trying to explain this to people. People that either don't listen, don't understand, or assume that the problem is as easy as flicking a light switch. 

It's not just that my hobbies aren't fun or interesting anymore, though almost all of them aren't. I haven't washed my hair in days. I think I get two or three hours of sleep on average. 

I keep getting asked to hang out with friends, and I keep having to politely decline because I can't bring myself to do anything. If I force myself to do things, I only end up hating those things. 

Video games aren't fun. Crochet isn't fun. Art isn't fun. Studying isn't fun. And if I didn't work at a grocery store, and I had to actually plan trips to buy food, I'm convinced that I simply wouldn't eat most of the time.

I'm always tired - due in part to my lack of sleep. But even when I've rested for a full six to eight hours, I'm exhausted and don't have the energy to do anything major. 

I don't care about things that I should care about. I get genuinely annoyed by most things now. 
So many games on my computer. So many art projects that I should probably finish. Plenty of crochet tutorials that I would just love to throw myself into. So many new recipes to try. But I'll start doing any of these things, get a few minutes into whatever it is, get distracted or start feeling miserable, have one of those moments of ""what's the point anymore?"", and then give up. Every time. Without fail. 

I don't think I've completed a personal project in months now, and even though I can get my tasks done at work quickly and efficiently, I'm back to being an unhappy, useless bag of rocks when I'm home. 

But I'm not choosing any of this, and if I am, I'm not aware of it. So to hear one of my friends constantly sound almost inconvenienced by this has kind of hurt. Having them go "" please go take a shower, 'for me'?"" a few times has made me resent them a little. Hearing that I should just do things and push through even if I don't enjoy them just sounds foolish. Because I'll *definitely* enjoy hanging out with my friends or cooking or making art whatever if I force myself to do it. This is the same friend that's said things like ""cheer up"" or ""calm down"" in the past in some pretty inappropriate situations, so my opinion of their methods might be a bit biased. 

It's not just this one person. My parents have never accepted depression as a real problem, even when they catch me staring into space for way too long, not eating for a day or two, or  only leaving my room for work. 

I don't know how best to explain this. It's frustrating to know that there's something wrong with my head, but I can't make people see what I see or feel what I feel. I don't want people to suffer, but I just don't want to be seen as either a lazy liar or some fragile, sickly thing that they have to walk on eggshells around. 

I am not okay. I haven't been in years. And 2025 has been genuine hell for plenty of people, not just me. So why is it so difficult to believe that maybe I'm not slowly sabotaging  my life and pushing away friends on purpose? I can't keep apologizing and trying to force myself to act normal when something inside of me is so fundementally ruined. It doesn't feel like I'll ever be okay sometimes. ","I do know where you’re coming from. Quite a lot, honestly, but the hard part is always explaining it. I’ve experienced a lot of people, if not everyone, not really understanding what it is I want to tell them. The worst of it when they actively don’t even want to try and understand, like it may shatter their entire worldview to believe someone couldn’t be fixed by just “cheering up”.

Our brains are stubborn. Weird. Frustrating. A lot of different things, but you’re also the sort of person who is… abnormally aware of yourself. You have a pretty strong sense of who you are, how you act, what you believe, and how your brain works in general. Some things you can’t control, and you’re aware of that. Things that, while you know how you react, you can’t tell why.

There is *always* a reason why. Those reasons often aren’t because of intent though, because yes, it isn’t that you want to feel this way at all. But our minds are complicated, and what we think and do can still affect us a lot of indirect ways. Especially for someone like me or you, people who sometimes think too much for our own good.

There’s almost too much to explain all at once. A lot of specific reasons why this happens at all, and things that are important to understand so they can be addressed to try and start turning things around. None of it’s straightforward, because of I tried to keep it simple, it’d be reductive.

If you’re comfortable with talking about it more and hearing me out, I’d ask: What do you want? What do you want from others that you aren’t getting now? What sort of goals do you want to have around this? What does feeling better look like to you?

Even if you don’t actually want much of anything right now, what would you want to want?

None of those answers need to be confident by any means. I know you even talked around some of it, I know you want people to understand and much more than that. But I also want to ask and hear how it feels to you right now. Even if you can’t see yourself actually achieving the things you may want, even if some of those ideas seem incredibly small or incredibly large.",1753732762.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbqmgm/apathy_and_emptiness_with_depression_nobody/,mentalhealth
Am I becoming a misogynist? Help!?,"So basically the story starts a few months prior, It would be a very long read but I made a post about it and you can read it if you want more context, but I'm giving you the short version here. I'm Indian but I don't look like the Indian you would Imagine in your head (a bit pale skin, light eyes). One of my friend's girlfriend dished out a tirade of racism against Indian men, unaware I was Indian, and guess what she's Indian herself. She's not apologized yet!

This has left me seething and I've now gone full psyop on twitter and reddit with women hating posts and most of my hate is centered around women, especially Indian! I'm getting flashbacks of all my interaction with Indian women and how they've treated me before and after knowing I was born and raised in India! (some of it might only be in my head TBH). And the recent uptake in Indian hate and constant attacks here in UK(and australia) has not helped my mental health!

It was alright till it was online, but now its spilling out into the real world! I've started giving a tough time to my friends and my throat and stomach just fills up with warmth, if I see a woman cracking even the slightest of joke at the expense of men (any man) whether it is offline or online!

I've gone to many subreddits and mostly people who have similar tendencies are frustrated due to their dating life, but that has not been the case with me as I used to regularly ask out women and at least score a date. I gave up later due to all of them failing or just turning into hookups and ghosting!

But this newfound hate is just towards Indian woman. I'm getting bombarded with misdeeds of Indian women on twitter lately and it just makes me seethe for a full minute! By seethe here I mean, I get annoyed and then give witty/borderlline derogatory answers to my co workers (mostly women and a lot of them are indian as well) which has led me to meet my senior once past week!

Have you ever felt frustrated by an impossible or unrequited love?,"Hello, I’m David, I’m 24 years old, and I would like to tell you a little about an unrequited love I had with an old friend. Two years ago I met online a boy from Spain named Miguel Ángel, I’m from Mexico. At first he seemed to me something intense that I thought he wanted him to be his partner or something like that, but as the days went by I began to like him a lot, since we could talk openly about whatever it was without getting uncomfortable, or even talk as if we were boomers. What I liked about him was his beautiful heart, his positive way, his desire to improve himself, his humility, that he was someone who did not always capture my attention because I almost never notice anyone.

I really liked talking to him, it seems that from the beginning he captivated me with his person. The only bad thing there was that he didn’t fall in love with me, but with another guy who had no other skill or talent than to show the meats online and that after the days of formalizing his relationship the guy left him two days after that.

At some point he told him what he felt for him, but he was not having a good time because he began to have emotional problems during an Erasmus in Belgium, after that his ex left him. In addition, he was not interested in those long-distance relationships, although if it had been the opposite, I would have been encouraged to be his partner like that. Previously I had moved away from him because I felt that he no longer cared about being my friend in part, until one day I apologized to him and he also apologized to me. That was nice. From there she told me everything she was going through and that she was having a hard time.

Months later, like in February 2024, I told him that I was interested and well he said not because of everything that was happening and that I was trying to overcome and days later I walked away from him again. In addition, when you declare yourself to a friend you feel that the friendship will no longer be the same.

It seems that I still miss him or that I still like him, I don’t know. Although a long time ago I decided to release something that damaged me and that could not be in reality, there are days where I get nostalgic when I remember everything I lived with him as friends or that my feelings for him were obvious when I flirted or flattered with him. For my part, I recognize that in the end I acted badly without saying things as they should be and I ended up leaving without saying goodbye to the friendship. Sometimes I think that I shouldn’t have answered him the first time he wrote to me online to avoid all the chaos and not to have fallen in love with him for not having been reciprocated, not because I hated him, and I have never hated him.

I saw him as my ideal person, and to date. I feel that if I met someone else I wouldn’t feel the same way I felt for my old friend. There were times when I dreamed of it after ghosting it.",,1753732380.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbqgfw/have_you_ever_felt_frustrated_by_an_impossible_or/,mentalhealth
Can I call this depression?,"Do you need to consider suicide or self harm for you to have depression? I've dealt with depression for most of my teens into mid twentys. I've been self medicating with marijuana or alchohol for way too long. It comes in waves. Most days are bearable, but some I see myself treating my personal relationships like shit. Too much pent-up anger and frustration with the situations I've dealt with. I've never thought of sucide as an option because I'm not that selfish. I was raised on putting others before myself. Im numb and I feel like the only use for me in the future is to support my future children and my family. I guess I'm confused about what this would be considered.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/mentalhealth) if you have any questions or concerns.* || Sooo good questions at the end. 

Firstly, what I’ve learned from attending many funerals, and being in a lot of difficult situations for other people, the absolute best thing you can do is just to be there, be present, listen quietly when she wants to talk, and use active listening skills by repeating how they feel about their stuff in your own words, and sympathizing with them. 

Sometimes you can just listen quietly while looking them in the eyes if in person. If they cry, accept them with a hug. Make them feel like their emotions are safe with you, and that you show gentle, soft, but confident affection for them either platonically or otherwise. Your presence and patience is all you need. 

>For the second one, what she did is called a “maladaptive coping mechanism” which means it’s destructive, and is a distress response. 

>What you should do is look up a [master list](https://positivepsychology.com/coping/) of healthy coping mechanisms and wield that patience to softly explore all of them multiple times. 

>some will work better for her than others, and pretty much all of them work MUCH better if they are done every day especially on good days. That way her body and mind are very, very familiar with the soothing sensations they bring, and it will help her calm down and feel better much quicker, and much more intensely.

>*if she’s the type to stop talking, shut down, and avoid the issue then it’s harder, but pushing and trying to get them to express themselves isn’t the way. Those people are like cats. Show that you’re safe and it’s a gentle and healthy vibe opening up to you, and they’ll do it more often. You kinda gotta let those types come to you.*",1753745655.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbvzpj/my_girlfriend_just_sh_how_can_i_comfort_her/,mentalhealth
"My whole life is based around the problems others around me have had, and accommodating how they feel.","It's difficult to sort of express exactly how I feel, which is why the title is so wordy.

And this post is unlikely to be seen, I don't know, no one ever seems to read these.

I just feel shitty about my life at present. I've come to realize its less of my own issues, my ""own"" problems in life, but rather the problems I deal with indirectly, which are those of the people around me.

I know this might sound shitty, as if I expect people to be all rainbows and sunshine. Which I don't. But I just wish they'd make time for how I feel too, or maybe make me feel like I atleast matter some to them, when things are alright for them.

For the most part of my childhood, my parents were (and are) at odds, staying together for the kids. In a way, they did things for me, but I also have to deal with their complexes. I never got to live a childhood like the rest of my friends did, which I don't have complaints about; I have a better life than most nevertheless.

I have very few friends. One guy friend and my girlfriend. When the former hit a rough patch, he didn't talk to me much, which I understand. I just felt really bad on days when I wanted someone to give me company for an hour on a walk. When my girlfriend goes through something, she has a tendency to hit out at me.

When I go through something, I don't say anything to anyone, because I know they either can't do anything about it, or that they'll get hurt, or maybe they'll get offended. It's not a good coping strategy either, but I can't have rough days. I just can't, because someone will be hurt or feel helpless or whatever. I just rush through the days. I rush through life. And some days it comes crashing down on me, and all I can do is feel like I'm alone and I'm bound to be alone.

I feel like I'm going to leave everyone someday, and live in a hut somewhere in a forest, and when I start to age, jump off a cliff like Gordon Childe."," I’m 17 male but I’ve always been very good at hiding my mental disabilities (autism/ASD, ADHD, dyslexia) but it has always backfired on me. I’ve pushed away people who were only trying to help. And the times I do open myself up, I’d have no idea if they were serious or not and the moment I said the wrong line, the people abandoned me.

I don’t know what your entire situation is like but for me, I’m glad to have my family with me. My mom has always loved me and my dad was also in a really dark spot as his business became more corporatized. Until recently, he never seemed to care about me or his other family members, it’s been forever since he’s talked to his closest childhood friend. This month he’s been trying to redeem himself after an incident he had with my aunt (losing his temper and knocking over a table). They’ve been the only people in my life to not make me feel weird. I have a couple of friends at school but that’s the only place we hang out.

I’m still trying to figure out everything but I know that it’s not the end of the world. I’ve learned to be more honest to others and myself and if they can’t accept that then I’ll find others who will. Life is never over until you actually do end it and I’ve came too far to do that now and you shouldn’t either if you are thinking about that.

So, to the bottom of my heart, I love you. You are loved even if you can’t see it. There will be people like me that will understand and empathize with you.",1753714130.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbi7o0/my_whole_life_is_based_around_the_problems_others/,mentalhealth
My friend died today.,"I met a guy on reddit in the beginning of july. I was raving about how my health was bad and that I wanted to be gone from this earth. He swooped in and helped talk me down. He offered to take me under his wing and let me live with him while also helping me with my medical situation. I'm quite a sick man. We were going to meet up this weekend for dinner to see if we'd get along. He went dark on me and I had a bad feeling. I just didn't wanna push too much. A message every few days seemed appropriate. Until this morning. I got a response from him on discord. It was his brother though. Telling me that he was gone and they found a note detailing why. It rocked me. Not only did my hope for a better future collapse, I was just in grief that he was gone. That he did what he had convinced me not to do.

Now I'm just left afraid that I will be next. My support, hope and future seems to be gone now and I am not taking it well. If he did it and his life didn't seem that bad to me, how am I supposed to carry on with all of my health issues. How am I supposed to find the will to go on when he couldn't. I've been facing the biggest challenges of my life lately and nothing is improving. Only getting worse. I just don't have the strength others have. I don't know how to carry on on my own.

Soon my issues will get to the point where I won't be able to endure the treatments. My life is on a timer. I just pray I find the strength to do what I have to do to be kind to myself when it comes time. I pray I will not be a coward and back out of what I need to do. My arm is full of hesitation marks and soon those will turn into my ultimate demise. I know how I should do it. I just hope it is successful for me. I know if this man couldn't make it I never will be able to either.","**Hello u/!**

Why am I an asshole no matter how hard I try not to?,I can’t seem to stop being an asshole and it’s destroying my relationship with my fiancé. It doesn’t matter how many times it happens and how many times I feel bad and remorseful for it nothing changes. I’m in therapy and go for medication this week but I have no idea what’s wrong with me,"Do you ever pause and allow yourself to process your frustration before responding? My current situationship has the same issues and from what I’ve observed, it’s bc he he’s so quick to react to everything he doesn’t like. It seems he’s incapable of actually self reflecting in the moment and all he can do is react. He also doesn’t know how to regulate his emotions. Maybe you should look into emotional regulation || Do you feel like your therapist is good? Are they challenging you to grow and dig deep or keeping you stuck? || I'm sorry you feel angst and frustrated about this. But you are not helpless, many people have found themselves in your shoes. Personally I've found myself more ""explosive"" than I'd like emotionally when there are things subconsciously I think is true but am uncomfortable about. I don't know if exactly that applies to you but I wouldn't be surprised it's something about your inner self that you and your therapist could work on more (although the subconscious absolutely can also be processed alone in one's own time). I don't know if this helps but I hope you feel better soon. || The fact that you’re aware and getting help means you *do* care that’s huge. Therapy and meds take time, but you’re on the right path. Try to pause before reacting and give yourself space to respond differently. You’re not broken, just working through something hard. Keep going. || Maybe it's worth checking on your attachment style? I recently had a similar experience with my partner where he couldn't figure out why he just turned cold and cruel even though it wasn't what he wanted to be to me. It was time to call it quits when he did some serious digging with his therapist. He found out he had a dismissive avoidant attachment style - meaning (for him) that because of some big time childhood trauma, that he felt internally unsafe and angry when someone came too close to him, even someone he loved. He hadn't ever been able to trust someone he loved, even his family. He had no idea previously why he was an asshole to me, even when he wanted me around. It's still a work in progress, but understanding that piece has changed so much for us. || I’m usually so caught in the moment that I can’t || I’ve only seen my current therapist a few times so it’s hard to say. He is pushing me to get on medication and trying to give me some coping skills || Well, she doesn’t see it that way. She’s just fed up || That makes a lot of sense for me.

Me and my friend..and their friend.,"I dont know what to do. Or rather - I know what to do. Im just not gonna do it. Yes. I know, I have to let them go. But its too hard, or maybe im just hopelessly desperate.

Its about my friend, lets call them S. Me and S were through a lot of stuff. We dated. We hated eachother. I comforted them, they comforted me. There was a period of when we didnt talk at all because for some reason I blocked them. I dont know - I was stupid back then.

They reached out to me first, even tho it was totally my fault. But im so grateful they reached out first, and we made up. It was great - daily talks, matching pictures, matching energy, just how it used to be.

We were friends. Dont get me wrong, we still are..but kinda not. Let me explain.

We dont talk anymore, but we never stopped talking if that makes sense. Neutral..I guess? But I think they hate me. After a bit of silence on both ends, I reached out. I said ""HEYY"". They were online, yet they didnt reply. I decided I wasnt gonna chase them.

Days passed. No reply. But theyre still online, hell - they even changed their pfp. TO A MATCHING ONE.

They clearly seen my text, but didnt even bother to answer. Am I not enough?? Do they deem me lesser than their other friend? It makes me wanna cry.

Sorry for yapping, I dont know what im doing. Also yes I know Im immature. Im working on it..am I overreacting or is this a valid reaction?",Honestly your over reacting but that doesn’t mean your tripping for feelings theses things it’s kinda obvious they don’t want to upkeep the relationship so they are already checked out so there’s rlly nothing you can do except grow from this but it might be hard because you already know that your immature so honestly just work on the maturity and then you’ll realize that it rlly doesn’t matter if two ppl decide not to talk to you,1753730473.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbpmbh/me_and_my_friendand_their_friend/,mentalhealth

i kept trying to heal by myself but it felt at first good im someone who is good with fixing stuff really am a fixer kinda person so it was easy to catch on whats wrong and work on it and guess what.... it went VERY well at first! 

the way i viewed myself and life really improved i felt way better but as soon as i realized its something i am good at i kept diving deeper and deeper in places i shouldn't really go into alone

started subconsciously from healing to overanalizing myself in a terrible way like cycles and cycles of reasons to why i am fucked up and should fix myself so subconsciously dissociatied ALOT to the point i got a panic attack for almost a whole day

i stopped myself today retreated myself and told myself its okay and its hard and i can do it and everyone falls at mistakes its good that i recognized when i dived too deep before i actually got to drown but i started questioning my sanity and if i could trust myself with healing myself anymore dont know if i should stop for now till i get a therapist or continue

 i have genuinely stopped trying to heal so bad today and relaxed more but i felt like a failure i improved the feeling by telling myself i should love myself unconditionally which i do but for my sanity do i continue this carefully or stop",,1753742433.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbuqkm/cant_tell_if_i_am_sane_anymore/,mentalhealth

Dark thoughts only when I sleep.,"I’m saying this is the most non concerning way, in simple terms 6 months ago had a shitty break up. Raised my exs kid as my own for 3 years since he was born. Fucked me up went to a dark place tried suicide. I’ve become extremely resilient in a way that I know exactly how to talk myself out of it. I have suffered a lot throughout my life with depression. I’m opinionated about the use of meds and honestly believe they may fix a person in hindsight create another problem on top of that. I won’t take them but anyway when you have battled with your head and your life so many times I’ve hit a point now where I know exactly what to do to avoid falling back down that low. I’ve learnt how to just move forward. I still question sometimes whether maybe I’m delusional and I’m just putting a Band-Aid on the problem and long term I’m fucked.

But anyway the last 2 weeks every night with out fail going to sleep I start thinking about killing myself. I know I won’t do it, but it replays over and over again until I fall asleep. No other time of the day just then. I’m at a point now where I’m bloody scared to go home to sleep because I don’t want to sit there for hours thinking that shit. So I sit at the beach. Now I sleep all day because I can’t sleep at night.","Fucking weird

A few months ago i had some suasidle thoughts scared to hold knifes that sort of thing not that bad im very scared of death

But every bad though worse when in bed

Your know why. When you go to bed you cant distract yourself anymore || I’m not scared of death because I know with out a doubt I won’t do it, and every time I did try, it wasn’t a dwelling on it for days thing it was an instant yep I’ll do it. I’ve never really had constant bad thoughts of suicide but this shit has popped up out of nowhere. It’s more of a mental frustration more than anything. I can’t stop it though. || Weird are you stressed || I think the better question is are you not stressed. I’m stressed 24/7 and if I’m not I’ll always find something to stress about. I’ve got a non hyperactive adhd as well. My brain is like a race car all the time. I was on meds for that as a young kid but sideffects, stopped my appetite stopped me sleeping. When I turned 18 I stopped cold turkey. I’m now 30 and it’s gotten so bad. Destroyed my relationship, my work life etc. I’m now highly considering getting re diagnosed to improve my quality of life. || I hyper analyse and think the brain is so much intelligent then we think. But this shit is wild. I could also have gotten so used to this depression I just think that’s normal now and this thought I’m having is much more serious but I’m just showing now emotion to it. || Yeah ok in 2 months im getting tested for adhd and autism || Yeah i can tell you can almost feel it from how you comment || I think it’s a trait adhd people have and if you work yourself out it’s an extremely powerful tool. Also I appreciate you chiming in here it’s good to have someone that is listening but after me and my ex broke up I spiraled hard to a dark place really fucked me ended up on suicide watch at hospital. But maybe this shit traumatised me that much that what I’m dealing with now is like some sort of almost ptsd from this trauma months ago. || Yeah it would make sense || Cheers buddy humans are so complex someone’s downfall can be another persons level up moment. But spaces like this really show the differences and it’s great to be able to share your story and someone else be like hey I do that as well. The knife thing has crossed my mind like you and it’s because I realised one wrong movement could take a life, same with car.

Sometimes I feel like a loser.,"Sometimes I feel like such a loser. I’m 25F and still at uni doing a degree I don’t wanna do but only doing it cause I know it’ll guarantee me a job. All my friends are in relationships and getting married. I hate it as well since I kinda currently have conflicting feelings for an online friend and I hate myself for it. I feel like such a creep and a weirdo and I’m so confused about what feelings I have. I would never do that to him tho and never go there since he a couple years younger than me. And whilst I do want relationships and stuff like that, i freak out if I get close and idk why. It’s like I get embarrassed with myself like “why are you in a relationship? You don’t deserve anyone. You’re a dork. Why would anyone like you? You’re an embarrassment and you shouldn’t be in a relationship.” It’s not them it’s me, and it was like that the few times I did get close ( a few years ago) to someone. I don’t go out either. I wish I did. It was my dream as a kid to go to theme parks or have sleep overs and stuff like that with a group of friends as a teen but I never did. I wish I was like all the other girls who go out and look pretty and get in relationships and have fun all the time. However I’m never invited. My whole life I was never invited. It was always for “close friends” and no matter how much I tried I would never be invited. I was always weird as well. I never got makeup or hair or fashion and focused more on tomboyish stuff like sports and movies and comics. I hate it. I hate me. I have diagnosed social and general anxiety and have since basically my whole life and recently depression. It’s gotten to the point that in the past few years (after a really crappy stressful job) I throw up nearly every time I go out whether that’s to restaurants, musicals/ concerts, or even if I need to do important stuff like appointments. It’s like my body goes into fight or flight and overreacts and makes me sick and now can’t even tell the difference between anxiety/nerves and excitement. I hate it and now I can’t go out without it ruining it. I am in therapy, read stoicism stuff and take meds and it’s like I’m ok with the “mind” stuff with anxiety but my body still reacts. I just wanna be normal. I wanna be like the other girls. I’m into “boyish” and geeky stuff and I’ll never look or act like the typical girl no matter how much I want to. I just wish I understood it ya know? Even if I try to do my hair or makeup or dress like them I suck and still look dorky or tomboyish no matter what or how hard I try. It’s causing my depression to come back. ","hi.
i understand wanting to be like other people and hating yourself for who you are, but wanting to be someone you are not so youll be able to do the things those people do…i dont think thats the way you should try to go.
as hard as it may seem, i think you should focus first on yourself! what do you like to do? why? why do you dress that way? who are you?
value those things, i mean, those things are what make you you! 
that would be the first step, i think. i also think that the university part is bounded to trying to pursue something thinking about the possible outcome. im not judging you, its perfectly understandable. but seeing how youre not happy, you should take that as an example on how you can act differently towards yourself.
from the point where you can accept yourself for who you are and appreciate it, or even before that, you can try to find people who like the same stuff you do or dress the way you do. i honestly dont really know how to do that, im gonna be honest. and having social anxiety the same as you do i understand the struggle in approaching people. 
a step forward would be maybe try to meet people online because of that matter, it could work. even so, i think meeting people irl is the way to go (thats just my opinion).
either way, i dont know how i can help you do that particularly. meeting new people is really spontaneous, you can try to approach someone, even if its just to make a small compliment or an observation, i think its always worth it.

besides all that, when you end up meeting people its a whole new world, you just have to get there. and the unfortunate part is that there is really no guide on how to. you either approach someone or they approach you, and i think the important part is being yourself and letting people get to know you, even if just from looking at you.

either way, i hope you can really get better and eventually meet people and im sure that when you do everything will be better (at least i hope so). if things get too hard dont hesitate to meet with a psychiatrist, your life is not worth wasting over struggles you cant control. i wish you luck and happiness, i believe its achievable, i really do.",1753741809.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbuhs8/sometimes_i_feel_like_a_loser/,mentalhealth
"Why is it still so hard for men to talk about emotions, sex, and mental health?","Unfortunately, I see a strong pattern—especially among boys and men—where it’s really difficult to open up about personal things like emotions, sex life, self-esteem, and mental well-being. It feels like something we’ve inherited from previous generations. A pattern that’s deeply ingrained and incredibly hard to break.

Men often have fewer close relationships, fewer regular social plans, and smaller support networks—which makes us extra vulnerable when life gets tough. That’s when our survival mechanisms kick in. We escape into hobbies, chase women or sex, or turn to alcohol… sometimes even drugs.

That said, I do think something is starting to shift—especially among younger guys. In certain spaces, it’s becoming more okay to speak up. To share our vulnerability without fear of being mocked, shamed, or seen as “less of a man.”

But change is slow.

What do you think it takes for us men to truly move forward? How can we become better at talking—to each other and with each other—about the things that really matter?","It's how we see the world as kids mam don't show weakness if we change the way we bring them up it will change in time but bullying in school makes it harder to make a change but it follows use to work and ever aspect of the male life to get thought it is luck to.the person that gets to but thay leave and or treet the male different after so we lock down again and islate || Last time I opened up a little all that happened was she had a go at me so made it wore showing that I as a male can't open up to anyone || There is definitely a positive trend on opening up, and some of that even goes beyond just looking at younger ages. I see all sorts of trends, some minor, some fluctuating, towards being okay with being “less of a man”.

I’ve had a lot of thoughts about what people need to move away from this, especially as a whole. I think it comes down to a couple ideas: Fear and hope.

When living in a life directed by fear, people are going to seek whatever form of security they possibly can. For men, there’s security behind the acceptance of “masculinity” (the broad, unhealthy traits of force and coercion) as it brings them into a well-established identity group and protects them from shame. This especially happens because, when living directed by fear, shame is *extremely* uncomfortable. Rather than be shamed by their peers for talking about emotions, opening about themselves, or showing genuine care for another, they cast those things aside out of the fear of shame from their peers. They do it so much, it becomes so engrained in them, that it eventually self-fulfills as well. They avoid those things because they’ll feel ashamed of themselves.

There’s a couple ways to address this. The one most people probably focus on is redirecting that shame. To shame them for being against sharing their emotions and for being against compassion. We try to shift the pressure they experience as a whole so that it becomes more shameful for them to hold their position than to concede and change their mind. It works, to an extent. This has especially been where a lot of change towards older people has come in as younger generations, children and grandchildren, become advocates for basically shaming their elders. A lot of older people didn’t even hold on to these ideas that strongly, and oftentimes aren’t even directly confronted about it. Just *seeing* the experiences of those in their family can be enough for them to realize.

But it’s slow. It fluctuates. Sort of like a war on which perspective can give off the most shame to convince people, because it is in the end still based on fear.

The younger generations have something else going on though. As much as they’ve been thrown into a world that seems unfair to them, a world that’s done so little good and they’ve seen so little improvement, they keep holding onto something.

They’re hopeful. Even inspired at times. It doesn’t include all of them, and most all are going to have some amount of fear and shame instilled in them, but it comes down to one question: What’s the easiest way to make someone change their mind? Not just to have them *tell* you they changed their mind either, or hide their opinion, but actually
make them want to change?

If we try to instill fear in someone to behave differently, we so often don’t actually change the behavior. The fear only demands that they hide it. They do it where we can’t see it. They find a way to still do the behavior but in a way we don’t notice. So we get what looks like fluctuations. We think some people are making progress, but they hide their behavior instead. When it becomes acceptable to them, when they believe it’s more shameful to not hide that behavior again, it comes right back. Sometimes they really do change their mind this way, but it’s not easy at all.

Make it a *good* thing to change their mind instead. Love. Joy. Inspiration. Hope. These things drive us SO much more than people realize, and these are feelings that can entirely sidestep fear altogether. We fear pain, but it only acts in a way as to *avoid* pain. We *strive* towards that which brings us joy. Fear only seeks the easiest answer, and fear is perfectly fine with accepting “less pain” or “good enough”.

Hope seeks out the best. We want to experience joy. We want to be inspired. We hardly need any convincing at all, and while inspired, shame suddenly seems entirely irrelevant.

Love especially drives a lot of this. We will do it a lot in the name of it, in order to feel more of it. *Especially* when we don’t have to fear losing it. If it’s a secure love, it dissuades worry and fear, and we will want to find more of it in whatever way we can. And if opening up about our emotions makes us feel more loved? Then by god people will do it.

More to the point of the question, make people feel good for talking about these things. Even for heavier things, it doesn’t have to be outright joy, but to even just make them feel more heard. More understood. More accepted. More connected. More loved. And stay as far away as you can from instilling fear or shame, should you actually want them to open up.",1753706481.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbf3no/why_is_it_still_so_hard_for_men_to_talk_about/,mentalhealth

My 14 yo brother keeps on having terrifying panic attacks because of his fear of death,"I am desperate, that's why I'm here. My family is poor, we don't have any finances to afford a therapist for my brother. And it seems I'm the only one who's truly concerned and trying to take some action, because their methods aren't working. They're trying to use psychology, when it's clearly a psychiatry case.

It all started, I think, very early in his age, probably before he was even 10 years old. I would boldly state that I am pretty sure my brother has death-related OCD or thanatophobia.

The symptoms that I can identify:
1. It started with his obsession with his health. He has a weird fear of showing his belly button to anyone because once he thought it was dirty and then just became overly obsessed with it. Our family laughed it off and just considered it a little odd, when only now I realize it's more than just a weird obsession.
2. As a kid, he would cry some nights and tell us he was scared of death. Very openly, but it wouldn't happen very often. Interestingly, I remember myself being a kid and feeling the same way, though when I'd become a teen I would be obsessed with horror movies and all the gore stuff and be as snug as a bug in a rug after. It's still weird how we're total opposites, both are obsessed with death in very different ways. I love criminology and forensic science and I consume the information that most folks find terrifying daily and feel just fine and unbothered.
3. We would never tell him anything about his health because he becomes so anxious about it. He would then ask many questions, randomly bring it up, cry over it. Even though he never had serious issues.
4. As a teen, he became a gaming addict. He would spend days and nights playing games. He never hangs out with his friends outside, tho he does have online friends. He doesn't do any kind of sport. He is always here playing games. And it intensified with the attacks that he started to have more seriously.
5. He would yell at me to shut up whenever I would talk about death. And not just death, but ANYTHING that is about human body and its vulnerability (?).
6. He ONLY sleeps with the bedside light on.
7. I'll describe his episodes. They happen every single night once or twice. Sometimes three times. I never saw it, but I hear it every time. He screams out of nowhere, sounds like he's in agony. Then he throws his pillow somewhere and my grandma rushes in his room. He then proceeds to calm down very quickly. But he can never sleep well.

To me it seems that he uses gaming as his personal compulsion. Even he told me himself, ""I play games so I'm not thinking about death"".

What do y'all think? What can be done to prevent it? Is his mental state dangerous to him or our family? Do you think he is able to harm anyone in this erratic state?

Anything would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

P. S. My grandma is also beyond anxious. She has insomnia overthinking every night. And now my brother having these attacks is only making her state even worse. I also suppose I have an anxiety-related disorder. I can never make mistakes, I'm a perfectionist to the core and I will push my limits to get to a point where I feel worthy. Sometimes it seems we all are insane in the same way, just basically have various types of the same disease.","Hey, I'm so sorry to hear that your dealing with this. He could definitely have some ODD, anxiety or something else.

If games are helping him not think about death, then let him play, make sure he eats and drinks though. It sounds like common sense, but people with mental illness can forget. 

How old was he when he first experienced fear of death? No kid wakes up on a casual Tuesday afternoon with the sudden, new fear of death, there's got to be a reason. 

Second question. Was his belly button the only body part he stated was dirty? I don't mean to scare you, but s\*xual abuse can cause those behaviors in young children. 

Why were you scared of death, did something happen to make you feel that way? 

If you're worried about him being a danger to himself or others, research the warning signs of suicidal ideation and homicidal thoughts. Never let him near guns. Period. Better yet, don't let him near firearms at all.

To me, it sounds like there's way more stuff going on. We aren't doctors, and we can't say definitively that he is a danger to himself/others, or how you can prevent it. || Hey, thank you for your response!

He drinks and eats normally, that's not a problem in his case. His gaming is overcasting his overall life, he can't even study in his state of mind, he just robotically goes to school and then suffers through homework and we can do nothing about it.

I can't say for sure how old he was, probably the same age I was when I was little. Maybe around 7 or 8 years old. For me, I was always a curious kid, kind of abandoned by my parents. My dad is a student book psychopath, never showed any empathy to me or anyone, though never hurt any of us other than with his words or his complete ignorance towards our problems. My mom had to work four jobs to maintain our family – me, my grandma and her. Then they got together after a divorce. Mom tried to save the family, thought he changed. She got pregnant with my brother then. I was very much into everything. Was extremely into mythical things, thus the afterlife piqued my interest. The only death-related childhood trauma for me would be my dad mercy killing a bird in front of a 4 year old me after our cat caught it. I had my own issues with SH and three attempts of you know what as a teen, but I grew over it. I'm only worried about my brother now. At least, he's not hiding it as I was when I was his age. He shows that to everyone and my mom is helping this time. In my case she threatened me with having no career in the future and that I don't have any problems and just want the attention (when in reality I wanted to crawl out of my body out of self-hatred and disgust). But anyways, the topic isn't me, I thankfully got my control and managed to release my emotions into sport, art and studying.

I get what you're talking about. It's very... Less likely but we never know. He's always been very... Ticklish (?) I'd say. Like he would tremble if you touch his arm or whatever. But trust me, he has ALWAYS been like that. I mean since infancy. I don't think that's the case. But yes, we can never know what could've happened.

Luckily, we live in an apartment. Me, him and my grandma. No guns, no firearms at all in the house. But the kitchen knives? Pillows? You can never know. People with mental illnesses just snap. I know that from my own experience. Even I could never know what I could do to myself or someone else. It's very unpredictable. The fact that one acts so erratically and aggressively all of a sudden is a sign on its own.

I wasn't asking for therapy or medication advice. I'm seeking an answer on what could be done. My mom got him a state psychologist, but with my unprofessional knowledge, she's doing nothing with her ""gratitude journal"". He's definitely not just an edgy teen with insecurities up his hind. I know it's serious. He also takes some sedatives, the ones that even a psychologist can prescribe. I, though, think they aren't helping as his symptoms increase.",1753740282.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbtvpa/my_14_yo_brother_keeps_on_having_terrifying_panic/,mentalhealth
I wanted to just talk about 3 times I was depressed. Don't mean to bring anyone down. Just no friends to talk with.,"I remember I used to watch even Stevens on Disney channel and it made me feel like I had friends. Like I had a social circle. I was very much an outcast in middle school. Bullied because I was bigger and taller for no reason. 


Right after high school I had a falling out with some people I thought we were friends but were working against me behind my back. I remember staying up all night watching a cheers marathon and halfway crying pretending I was there where everyone knows my name. Sounds pathetic right? 

Then my childhood hero, someone I luckily got to meet several times JDF Tommy the green ranger etc. Passes in the worst way. It broke my heart. I laid back in bed pulled the covers up and remember staring out the window. I want moving and my wife and kids just thought I was asleep. I began to have a real bad F*** it attitude. My health has declined. I'm trying to myself out. 

I have no adult friends besides some that are states away. I sometimes feel so stupid for letting bad people make me think they were my friend. I've been tricked and used repeatedly. Lost jobs for ridiculous reasons and left with dreams that are just dreams. 

I'm currently counting calories and seeing doctors to correct my health and I love my kids and wife so damn much. They are the best part of my life. I just get bummed when I dont have friends to hangout with sometimes like the good ole days.

Now, I’m a complete robot…every emotion I feel is now controlled by another person, I feel no internal joy based off of what I do from my free will. Everything I do is quite frankly, forced, fake, and just emotionless. I really don’t know why I’m typing this, it’s a cry for help I guess but I know nothing will change. Elon Musk has gained complete control over my body, mind, and now absent soul due to him. I never knew someone could be so evil as to actually play God and take someone’s free will away like this. I hangout with people to not hear Elon Musk, I don’t connect with anyone because you have to naturally FEEL a connection with them, I don’t feel internal joy unless Elon GIVES IT TO ME. The give of this situation is NOWHERE NEAR the take from this…..no emotion I feel is from my internal being, it’s given to me by Elon Musk…the psychopaths even make a joke about this saying “I guess we can give him this” in terms of emotion and things like that. Do you all understand this? This is an undeniable truth, I SAW CELEBRITIES SPEAK TO ME THRU MY PHONE FOR DAYSSSSS… other people don’t hear voices saying “oh well we’re going to take your nervous system away or your brain power away” and then it’s ACTUALLY TAKEN AWAY…..it’s just mesmerizing how every single human abides by this at this point but I get it because them telling me the truth would just make it worse. I truly don’t feel joy in my life and thus, I hate my life….every emotion is GIVEN TO ME… how or why WOULD I FEEL ANY PRIDE in myself when EVERY. SINGLE. EMOTION. Is not natural. My God I miss drugs, it’s a major step up from this hell I live in. And Elon will continue thinking this is cute….its all just a game to him and that’s it CUTE…being a literal demon is just cute to him….and no one does ANYTHING about it. I’m trapped, and there’s nothing I can do about it . ","**Hello u/!**

I can't think of a thing where i was really happy recently,"My mental health is decreasing day by day since 2020 from all this loneliness and i don't even have a friend with i could talk this through. So many negative thoughts are building up inside my head like will i be successful? Will i find some good friends? Is there any love for me out there? Am i worth something? And i ain't a lowlife, i workout 5 times per week, i study, trying to eat and live good but it just keeps getting worse inside my brain, i can't get these thoughts out of there. And on top of that i discovered today that my parents want to take a divorce and that wrecked me too cause i have a pretty good contact with both of them.

Always something I wanna run away from,"I think that's why it's my go-to response for any sort of upsetting situation ever. As a kid my parents hated each other. Then I had to hide being gay and my relationship with my mom was horrible. Then my relationship with my dad was horrible. Now my I'm constantly scared my stepmom will pick a fight with my dad.

Always on edge, never catching a break. There will always be something to run away from and if that's just how life is, I'm afraid we're back to the conundrum of me not wanting to live it.

Is it normal to want to have a panic attack?,"I had two months ago, and they were embarrassing for me. I did not at all enjoy them. But I want to have another one because last time I ATTEMPTED to throw away a bunch of clothes and stuff in my room to clean it up, which would've helped me. And I feel like if I have a panic attack I'll be able to do something good for myself since im at my dads and he wont stop me. And I slept REALLY good last time. ","Look man, the last thing I want is to have another panic attack. I fight tooth and nail daily to avoid having another panic attack. And no matter what, it always catches up to me. I think of nothing other than I am in a current state of actively dying when I am panicking. I don’t know how someone would want that, so that they get laundry done.. || Its not something like that at all, I promise I dont want a panic attack to do my laundry or clean my room.

I think ending it is the best solution.,"I’m 15F, autistic and exhausted of being alive. In a world where to matter how hard I try, everyone hates me.

Been bullied since I was 4. Been considering attempting since I was 7-8, been doing sh since I was 9, been groomed when I was 11 till I was 13, my parents are abusive, dont care about my health and mental health and dont make me feel like I’m their daughter.

I just…. Dont know what to do to be loved anymore. Life isn’t worth living for. And pleas if you’re coming to comment “but youre so young” “maybe its just hormones…” NO. I dont need that type of comments to make me feel even more invalid and misunderstood.

I honestly feel like doing sh daily, and I wanna go deep, really deep.

Plus I have those hallucinations, that I was told werent normal, but also told they were, but I realised most people I know barely even experience them while I experience them multiple times a day…

That post will most likely end up like most of my posts : Barely seen, downvoted.

I just need help. But do I deserve it? Do people automatically hate me upon meeting me? It seems like it


EDIT to avoid confusion: I am not planning on ending it  RIGHT NOW. But I’m thinking about it a lot.","**Hello u/!**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/mentalhealth) if you have any questions or concerns.* || You are not alone, and you are not leaving us - we are not departing. What you’ve been through is unimaginable, and none of it is your fault- you deserve love, care, and healing, even if the world has been cruel. Right now, it might feel like no one sees you or understands, but that doesn’t mean your life isn’t worth living.  It is, and you are worth every ounce of help and kindness this world can give. Please, if you feel like hurting yourself, reach out for support….text or call a crisis line (in the U.S., 988), message a trusted adult, or talk to someone who can listen right now. You don’t have to fight this alone, and you don’t have to stay stuck in this pain; there are people who want to help you survive and feel alive again. || Ending everything is never the best solution. I'm not sure if anything I say will help, but I truly do hope things get better even if it seems like they won't. If you can, get professional help from your doctor. You could also try picking up some hobbies to pass the time and let your emotions out. I really, really do hope life will get better for you though, I mean it. || youre worthy of all the love in the world.. you need exposure to a nurturing accepting environment to be able to learn how to provide it to yourself though.. being able to feel your own love is the most important || First of all, I wanted to say that I’m sorry you’re going through this. Depression, bullying, and abuse are really hard to cope with when you’re already using all of your energy on keeping yourself alive. Secondly, I wanted to give you a piece of advice. I know you’ve probably heard a lot of different perspectives, most of them being “killing yourself is never the answer.” I don’t find that particularly helpful, and I’m sure you don’t either. The way that I personally get through life is by telling myself “you’ll always have the option to die. But once you do it, there’s no coming back.” I know life is really hard for you, and I know that it might not seem worth living. But it’s important to remember that you ARE young. You are 15, and also dependent on your abusive parents and likely still in school. There are so many things that can change for you in the next couple of years— getting your drivers license, getting a job (which means more financial independence), etc. And even more doors will open for you when you become an adult. Will this fix your depression? Honestly, who’s to say? It might, and it might not. But I’m sure it will help you in a lot of other ways, and I’ll place my bets on you being grateful in the future that you chose to stay alive and make it out of the hell you’re currently in. This is NOT forever. Again, you can always choose to die. But why do it now? Why not give it a little bit more time, just to see how things change? || Things only get better when you get out of an abusive home. My son had a friend in a similar situation in HS.. very suicidal, terrible family life, etc and is now in their senior year of college and very happy. Do you have anyone you can reach out to? || Listen to me friend. There’s one thing you need to learn, it’s learn to love yourself. You have to do that first. My second advice is pray to something- god , meditate, whatever because it forces you to accept that you want help and a change, it will start to re wire your head. Lastly don’t leave, things can get better and you will see the other side. Everyone deserves help, everyone deserves to be loved, especially you. I’ve thought about ending it every other day since I was your age. I’m now 33 and I thank everyday that I didn’t end it- things got even harder at times- but there’s something to be said for learning to enjoy the little things- your favorite food, a sunset with fireflies out, the excitement of a new movie or video game, every single experience helps make life worth living. Keep at it fam || You are not alone in your suffering. I, and many others on this sub, have been in a similarly painful situation. Noticing that something feels wrong is the first step in healing; you have done that, so please give the part of you that reaches out for help some compassion. I want you to know that your emotions are COMPLETELY valid and deserving of care/attention. I also believe you need a release. You need some form of expression that transforms your suffering into art. Tell me, what inspires you? || Never give up. Never give up. I’ve been where you are. It’s trite but one thing in the near future may change it all. Of course I probably wouldn’t have listened to any of this BS in the throes of my psychosis back then.  

Just hold on one minute. The hold on fifteen.. And so on. Hang tough.  Hate this for you. || Fist of all this is probably an episode it will pass soon if it hasn't already and second I'll tell you something that gets me through mine most of the time, it's a chain of thoughts so bare with me..

Just say fuc em, fuc em, my time will come.... The only absolute truth in this world is that time changes all, time effects everything and everyone, i have seen it in my short life span of 22 years and if you have not you will see it very soon, some people who seem like  they can hurt you they are in power right now will fall you will be in a different place and thats the only granted thing if you stick around, it is the nature of life.

As for love I'd say don't try so hard, its not what you think it is, i wanted the same thing not so long ago but not really something I'm too sure about right now, and please try making a script of sort to say to your self to get you through these times, try making some thing personal I'm a guy so mine is mostly about anger or about sa or I'll prove them wrong one day....
your's should be about what you really want in life what would make you happy. || please don't , have as much time off as you need and idk if it's possible but you need some confidants . It's a really unfortunate situation there's a possibility that because of the trauma you can't really open up to others which result in you feeling like you're alone but i really hope your situation gets better and yk Reddit has some pretty nice people that you can talk to when you need to || I understand how awful it can feel. I got bullied in my younger years. Beat up, toenails ripped off etc.

You’re only 15! While that probably seems old to you it’s not. 

There is so much more to life than what you have experienced. 

Be brave and experience that life. || Hey, listen sometimes we are placed in a wrong environment, I cannot even imagine myself going through it YOU ARE STRONGER THAN YOU REALISE that's why you were able to push through life no matter how hard the time was. 

I will share some practical steps until help arrives so try to do these and keep moving even though it doesn't feel like it.

1. Start loving yourself and start taking care of your body and your mind first. Okay? So everyday even when you not feel like it, dress well, do some exercise or running even for 5 mins a day but yeah move your body and your mind will start to get stronger with your body.

2. Try to focus on your goals I know it is hard really hard but yeah even 1% improvement everyday is enough.

3. Seek a therapist as soon as you can.

Your life matters a lot why? Because you don't know what is ahead of you. Somebody hates you or love you it doesn't matter if you love yourself and set healthy boundaries. 

Remember others don't get to decide our life. It is us who decide what to do so based on hate of others please don't take a wrong step.

You know? Warriors face too much in the battlefield but when they are back home surviving they become role models. 
You can also become a role model for The World and help many people The World needs people like you. So please keep living keep fighting until the storm settles down. 

All The Best for your life ahead. I wish you Goodluck 👍💪😊. || I'm an autistic adult, and I'm really sorry all of this has happened to you. I myself have had the exact same things happen, I was a little older than you but only by a year or two. It does get easier, and you will find people who love you and you won't have to do anything to make them love you because that's not love it's abuse. Just think about it you can choose to live in spite of everyone who's every hurt you, or you can end it all and the bullys will win. Your young and you have so much to do yet don't end it all before life has even begun, maybe think about the things you want, not whether they are achievable right now but just make something up, what would you have if you could have anything in the world.  || Im 14f (almost 15) and also autistic, i know exactly how it feels, you are NOT alone!!!! It will get better, but just because it does, that doesnt mean there wont be down points that are hard to get up from, life is difficult with issues like this, but finding people who support you is the best thing to do, i am always open to new friends!!!!  || All this advice and comments, yet you still the only one that can straight things out. Life is not good nor bad for every one of us. We may not really understand or feel someone's pain or loneliness in their heart but. Living and experiencing things is the purpose of life. We are not really here to be happy to have money, to have family care for others. But to experience and see things. Good nor bad, be happy or sad. I hope you can reconsider things and look beyond what your eyes see. Sometimes it's worth living just to see how things work out for others. Thank you for sharing your life. || You have here if you need to ask questions and people who actually care about your wellbeing. Trust me. I get what you're feeling. I tried twice and failed. Currently 31. Didn't expect to last past 16 years old

You're still a beautiful soul who needs help and guidance. I'm sorry all that stuff happened to you when you were younger. But I do assure you it doesn't define you nor does it restrict you from being the best person you can be. || same i am going to do it the best way tbh || Theyre trying to control your mind by projecting their own core fears and rejections upon you. Some people become hungry for control sometimes and they do it in weird and often abusive ways. 


Don't lose hope - You're a chosen one. You'll gain the power of self determination theory after you've evolved a bit more and made progress in your ""Hero's Journey"". You have the power to work miracles, you just have to survive long enough to know how to transmute negative and destructive energy into positive and constructive energy. 


I highly reccomend doing some counseling or therapy to help you build emotional discernment, self regulation, and resiliency skills. There are free informative resources online as well. EFT helped me overcome trapped emotion and stress, CBT/DBT helped with echoing thoughts, emotion regulation, and mindfulness.  


This is all something I wish I could have told my 15 year old self. I really hope you find the connection you need to find your spark 🫶🏻 || I'm in kind of a similar situation but a lot less extreme I can definitely empathize with just being chronicly exhausted with life. But there are many factors of your situation that seem like if and when they improve it might very well really improve your mental well-being. I'm not trying to just say oh it gets better, but I don't really know you might want to or look forward to getting to know the person you are/can be in less shitty scenarios. I genuinely don't know if that kind of thought process would be at all helpful to you but I hope it could be a little bit. I don't know you but I'm 100% sure that something that you could do in the future will help someone. Even if it's very little and kind of butterfly effect type things. I'm really bad at the idea of living for myself/ just because im alive, so it helps me when I think of how my continued survival could potentially help good people",1753658612.0,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mb0qoi/i_think_ending_it_is_the_best_solution/,mentalhealth
I don’t like losing people,"I hate the fact that I’ll eventually have to deal with losing people 
I really think I’m not strong enough to deal with grief, I wish I could just be friends with robots Instead so they never leave me.

I’ve been fantasizing about 3 characters just to cope with loneliness, I daydream about hanging out with them, having conversations with them, and being comforted. It really is just them that will stay with me permanently. I’ve been day dreaming about those same characters for years now. 
It may help me cope but it still hurts me knowing those characters are just made up and all that i really have is myself, I hate being a loser who fantasizes about having friends. I really really wish they were real. 

It just makes me feel so suicidal being like this. I’m so weak for not being able to deal with losing people.
I just wish i was never born so I don’t have to feel this way. I really don’t like the feeling of grief","**Hello u/!**

Selective mutism and its impact. I need support,"On a normal day I don't really remember I have selective mutism, because I'm so used to it. Which is weird, because I know I can't speak properly and there are plenty of situations that should remind me of SM, but at the same time I don't think about the diagnosis despite it all. Because when I do remember, such as right now, it makes me feel paralyzed. Suddenly, I also remember so many situations where people started seeing me as a person only after we have been chatting online.

One instance was at a daycare clinic theee years ago where I was talking to a guy from the clinic 24/7 for two weeks (we both had covid), and when we saw each other at the clinic, he was actually so excited to see me, was constantly talking to me, and it's so shameful, but it's veeeery rarely the case that someone acts this way with me. He then noticed my lack of mimic, gesticulation, and that I'm just not rlly saying anything and stopped. It's hella weird, but we then never spoke for those 8h at the clinic for three whole months; but every single day, once we were both in the car, we started texting till the late evening. And we never talked about it. My SM, how strange it is and so on. Actually, I made four ""friends"" this way at that clinic, and I only talked to them in person when we were alone, because I physically can't when there's a second person in the room.

I hope that my SM will improve, but I still don't have a support system whatsoever. Slowly, it's getting veeeery noticeable that I'm far behind, after having spent my formative years in my four walls. Others my age move out, go to uni, travel and so on, and I am going back to 11th grade to repeat my a-levels. (I dropped out a year ago) Some things have changed - I got diagnosed with AuDHD, am medicated relatively well - for my depression and ocd, I can talk to my parents in public, school will be partly online, I am better at a few small things; but what comes after school? And what comes now?

I have tried plenty of things to ground myself, improve my mental health, such as sports and journaling, but I really really want to be a proper part of this society and fit in. At least find my people, even a few irl. I quit my second job after two weeks (the first one after two weeks as well, even tho I wanted to work and still do) cause of bullying. There was a guy who was testing everyone, and you had to ""protect yourself"" verbally. When he noticed how quiet I am, he started making remarks constantly (don't wanna elaborate, doesn't matter) and has been throwing cardboard boxes at me. The boss was so much worse. What did I do?

1. I managed to say sth once, but it wasn't enough and didn't change anything for me.
2. I reported the boss for her bullying via email. What I'm trying to say: I almost always go over to written communication which one could see not as a weakness, but rather a solution-oriented approach or whatever, but still - I don't want it to be my life.

Reported abuse. Therapist quietly removed from website. Trainee who defended him promoted. Is this justice or PR optics?,"I had reported a boundary violation involving a male therapist who emotionally entangled me while I was in a vulnerable place.
 The owner of the organization removed his profile from their website but not other social media and made updates saying no therapists are affiliated with their organization. They just promote therapists on basis of votes and who is most ethical.

But here's what I found disturbing , the trainee who was working under that therapist and was aware of the unethical behavior was not publicly addressed. In fact, weeks later, this same trainee was promoted on the organization's official page. 

I had specifically told the founder that I did not want the trainee punished, only that things be handled with integrity and care and trainees should be taught well but this feels like erasure, or worse like loyalty to even unethical therapists is being rewarded. 

Is this common in the mental health world? 
Do organizations protect their own and rebrand scandals as progress? Or am I misreading it all?

Would appreciate thoughts ,  especially from people who’ve worked inside therapy training institutes or mental health orgs.",,1753724246.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmsm9/reported_abuse_therapist_quietly_removed_from/,mentalhealth

I live in a constant state of derealization — but sometimes I catch a glimpse of the world as it “should” be,"Hi everyone,  
I’ve been struggling with chronic derealization for many years now. Most of the time, it feels like I'm looking at the world through foggy glass — everything feels distant, dreamlike, and not quite real. I function, but it’s like I’m detached from life, like I’m watching it from the outside.

But occasionally, usually just after I wake up, I get these short, vivid moments where everything looks incredibly clear and beautiful. I look at my hands or the room around me and it feels like I’m truly *here* for once — present, alive, and connected. It feels so intense and real that I almost want to cry. Like I’m seeing the world the way I used to as a kid. Nothing feels fake in those moments — just raw, bright, and real. It only lasts a few seconds or minutes, but I can’t stop thinking about it afterwards.

I think I used to see the world like that all the time when I was little. But something changed when I was 14. I had to be hospitalized with peritonitis, and because of the infection and the stress, I had really bad hallucinations and trauma. After that, I had nightmares for months, kept waking up thinking I was trapped in the Matrix or losing my mind. It was terrifying. The intense fear eventually faded, but ever since then, it feels like a part of me disconnected. That vivid perception never fully came back.

Now I’m not even sure what “normal” perception is anymore. The derealization feels like my baseline. I don’t know if what I feel now is trauma-related, dissociation, or something else entirely.

Has anyone else experienced something like this — where the world sometimes suddenly feels real and vivid, but most of the time it’s flat and distant? Is this just chronic DP/DR? Can it heal?

"I feel like someone’s always watching me — every day, for years. Is this a mental illness?","I've had this issue for years and it's getting worse. I constantly feel like someone is watching me — not in the paranoid ""they’re spying on me"" way, but as if there's always someone present in the room. This feeling is strongest when I'm changing clothes, showering, working out, or doing anything private.

These “observers” aren’t real people — they’re imaginary characters I created over time. Some are based on fictional characters or people I know, but they’ve morphed into their own versions. I never talk to them, they don’t speak — it’s just a strong sense of their presence. It started as harmless daydreaming (like imagining myself as the main character to music), but now it’s daily, automatic, and I can’t shut it off.

Sometimes I even imagine how these characters would react to seeing me — which recently became disturbing. For example, I had an intrusive thought in the shower where a fictional ""observer"" reacted to me being naked like I was ""clean, good material."" That thought disgusted me, but now I can’t unsee it, and it comes back every time I undress.

I understand these aren’t real and I’m still functioning normally — I go about my day, I know reality is reality. But these thoughts feel intrusive, uncomfortable, and constant. I don’t hear voices or believe in conspiracies. It’s more like a background mental noise that won’t go away.

Is this a form of OCD, maladaptive daydreaming, or something else? I can't afford therapy right now, so any feedback would help.","I(11m) have smth similar. I always feel like somebody is in the room and I'm scared they'll kill me or take me. The creature is like a black thing with red eyes and a creepy smile and its kinda liquid, it's like tentacles or smth. It scares me so fucking much that sometimes I'm scared to even just move so that the creature won't notice me || Hey, thanks for sharing. I’m sorry you feel that too - your description really creeped me out. Mine aren’t that scary, but I also feel like someone is always there. Not visible, but just present. Let me know if yours ever go away or if something helps :) || I know what you mean, although I haven't found anything that helps ajd my parents just say ""yeah yeah there's nothing there just mellow out child"". Hope your situation isn't preventing you from, doing things, good luck!",1753723872.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbmmjb/i_feel_like_someones_always_watching_me_every_day/,mentalhealth
"I feel like something is wrong with me emotionally, but I’m not sure if it’s normal or should I seek help? Is this normal teenage things or?","I’m 17F and I’ve been struggling with how I handle my emotions. I don’t really know what’s “normal” and what’s not, but I’ve been feeling like the way I react to things is not normal, mainly bc I’ve never met someone who is like me. I’m not self-diagnosing, I just want to know if this sounds like something worth looking into.

Here’s what I’ve noticed:
	•	My moods change very quickly and usually depend on how someone treats me or what they say. A bit of background: it feels like someone is always mad at me for something I did or didn’t do. I live in a place where a lot of people my age know each other, so rumors or comments about me get back to me through friends. When I hear what people I don’t even know say about me, it ruins my mood and makes me want to confront them. If it’s something stupid, I usually just rant and let it go. Also, I can’t stand my mom, every conversation with her stresses me out and irritates me, though the feeling goes away pretty quickly afterward.

	•	When I think someone might leave or pull away from me, I panic. There was this guy I only knew for a month, I wasn’t romantically into him, but I desperately wanted him to stay in my life. When he pulled away, I texted him over and over, begging him not to leave. Till this day, I still think about him and sometimes want to reach out, ask if he’s happy, or doing ok. He was mentally in a bad place, and I thought I could help him, but when we got closer, he ran away because he was scared to get attached. I don’t meet many people I feel that strongly about, and I’m young, so I don’t know if that’s normal.

	•	I have intense verbal outbursts, especially with my boyfriend I’ll have a full mental breakdown and cry and yell. Most of the time it’s not his fault. it’s really about things I wanted to say to someone else but couldn’t. Even after I let it out on him, I still think about what I wanted to say and can’t move on. I just want to get it out, no matter the consequences. Usually these things I want to say are confrontational, mean, or spiteful, but they feel necessary. When I can’t say them, it’s like my skin itches.

	•	At night, I sometimes feel empty and think about running away or even how I’d die if I wanted to. I would never act on it, but those thoughts are there. I then just go to sleep, it takes a while to fall asleep and it’s usually not even a good sleep. Is this like normal night time low serotonin low mood and stuff or something. 

	•	I’ve been told (and I know) that I’m “too much” sometimes. My boyfriend often says I’m being dramatic, and maybe I am, I probably am, but I can’t help it, I just need to confront yell or do something to someone. Sometimes i over explain things a lot, i just don’t think anyone understands me.

	•	The only person I feel somewhat safe with emotionally is my boyfriend, but even with him I try to hold back because I know it’s a lot to handle. 

Does this sound like something I should bring up to a professional? Or could it just be normal teenage emotions that I need to work through on my own? Part of me feels like if I had a diagnosis, it would make me feel better because at least then I’d know what I’m dealing with. I’d rather something really be wrong with me than just me being me, I wouldn’t want to be me. My impulses has affected my relationships with ppl around me and my days and my mood I guess. 

Any advice or insight would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading.",,1753736826.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbsf72/i_feel_like_something_is_wrong_with_me/,mentalhealth
M36 I dont want to find out anymore,"So let's start im a m36 and I guess I need to give a bit of background first 
 i was in a 13year relationship wiith a girl who was the same age as me.
 I was abused constantly this ranged from saxually where she would get mad if I sad no and if I did she would just wait till I was asleep so she could do what ever I got woken up more than a few times like this. 
She used to hit scratch bite at one point when I tried to get out the flat away from her she grabbed my hair pulled my down on the stairs put her knee on one side edge of a step on the other and pulling my hair while screaming at me about where do I think im going.
She appeared with a knife one time then stabbed a load of holes in the wall and said next time... wheel stareing at me.
She has im fairly sure spiked me as there has been a few times i felt like I got slammed by a tonne of bricks and soon as I sat down id black out. Extream stalking. Entrapment. Threats. Faking being attacked for anyone who could hears benefit (i did film these for when the police turned up i filmed most interaction because I figured it was the only thing stopping a her word against mine issue (it dident) .

There are meny more but that would be a book it was over a long time after all.

So thats the background or so I thought too 
I have adhd and dyslexia and im not going down the path or treating the adhd to make my life a little easier part of that is therapy and this is where my problem arises 

First issue much as I can rant about what she did to me like above I find hard to atchully hate her or even dislike her some times like i have to read an old message and be like ohhh yeah i remember. I keep finding out more things I dident relise were abusive behaviours that were haplning to me or it makes me remember more about it i get this is or can be part of the healing prosess.

But what is this suppression crap like it turned out I was s/a as a child but would to of appeared to not relised it or what ever reason I dident tell im not sure but I remember it vividly now and I really dont want to. 

I've really had both sides of the coin growing up and I guess ive just used to taking 
The good with the bad and my dad was a military hard ass so I got a lot of ill give u something to cry about ect. 

Me and my dad ha e reconciled all of this so that part is fine just a hit more background. 

Im just getting worried about finding out more how am I forgetting or blocking this stuff.

Its affecting the way I think everytime I find something out its killing me inside. 
Im not sure how to pose a question here except those who have found out stuff like this or delt with suppression and its starts coming out how do you deal with your own head at this point 

she died she according the the coroner's report she was in the region of 4x the drink drive limit ( this was said for us to understand how much was there as apposed to the mil of alachol to mg of blood) and drowned in the bath when this happened I had been out the house and separated for about a few months o was never told I found out a day before her frunal and when I called her mother the whole thing was slammed on me the death was listed as missadventure

Self-Identity issues - what is the real me?,"I (M21) have been struggling with my sense of self lately, I can’t seem to figure out who I truly am at my core. 

People describe me in very positive ways - confident, optimistic, mature, kind. 
Yet, I really struggle comprehending that and believing those things since I truly think I’m not a good person. 

My thoughts are negative, judgemental, mean and just all around bad, even towards the people closest to me.
I just choose not to act on those thoughts since I know it’s morally wrong to be that way, especially to those undeserving and innocent. 

So, do my actions define my character and who I truly am at my core? 
Or is the real me the one within my thoughts saying all these negative things?

I’m tired of being told I think to deeply into things when all I’m needing is understanding. This is who I am as person.,"Hi there,
I’ve been in this state for a while now not knowing exactly how to feel about anything. There is a load of mental confusion that has me now randomly bursting into tears in public, feeling judged, belittled, not enough, hateful, unsupported and i feel that I am hyper emotional. I’ve always been constantly denied to the room to open up and am usually rushed off as annoying or not worth hearing. The feeling of being unaccomplished put the cherry on top.

I had a moment yesterday where my mother asked my little brother to pass the syrup from his plate. I could see his hands were busy as he was rushing to scarf his food down, so I thought I would help by passing it to her for him. Trying to be helpful. He yells “why couldn’t you let me pass it to her?” I didn’t think there was a reason to speak to his older sister like that but it made me feel stupid, unneeded. Such a small thing suddenly became a big matter for me in a couple of seconds. I felt the emotional breakdown coming. I started to tear up doing my best to swallow my tears. Because I knew what was to come next. My mother’s judgement.

“Why does your face always look so vexed?” “You can’t ever go out and have a good time.” “You’re always thinking too deep, it ruins the mood.” “We can’t take you anywhere.” 

The thing is I know she’s the cause of why I’m like this. It was drilled into me growing up “think before you move.” “Think before you talk.” “Watch your mouth.” Note it was never because I was disrespectful. It was when my response is “no” or if it was to make someone else comfortable.

I am now always thinking about everything. I feel I have sacrificed myself emotionally and mentally for everyone else and feeling of when I feel it’s my turn to have someone listen, no one is willing. I am tired. Tired of feeling neglected, tired of feeling I am the black hole, tired of the fake love, tired of everyone pretending to care. I feel a deep sense of hatred coming from the pit of my gut and I would rather it not get to that point.

I am writing this as I’ve just got done bawling my eyes out in the airport bathroom and having further negative thoughts that this will all just end. I want to drop off the grid. Not have to seek anyone, call anyone (family or friend), just be by myself.

I can’t do this anymore.

There’s only 4 colours and I can’t pick, it’s 2 days I can’t start playing because I can’t choose. I’m damn degenerate.","Well, I am having the super complicated decision of not knowing which therapist to meet. || Growing up has someone always made choices for you? Maybe a parent or friend or something or maybe has someone scolded you as a kid involving making choices and them being perceived as wrong choices? From my knowledge when someone cannot make a decision no matter how basic is because growing up decisions even the basics were either made for them or always scolded because of it, lets try something very basic and not wrong or right, do you prefer to look at red or blue? I personally like blue because it's a more relaxed colour to me. Red can also be a relaxing colour as well. There is no wrong or right answer, and if you can't pick one that's okay too. || I've given up... But hey talking to yourself ain't that bad either || Yea, maybe my parents take a little more decisions for me then needed. But the problem with deciding was much better before and now become worse.

It’s game about samurai and you need to choose 1 of 4 horses as transportation and faithful companion.

There’s white - seems good, it’s pure and beautiful, but on other side it’s too bright and not good for some stealth samurai, also sometimes white seems boring, like just white for whole game?

Black - badass and hardly noticeable at night, other side it’s too dark make my game less colorful, and just black also seems boring and doesn’t stand out. 

Dapple gray - it have unusual color, its tail 2 colours black and white. Otherside color seems boringly gray and somehow dirty and I don’t like 2 colored tail but sometimes it seems great and unusual tail.

Brown with black tail and mane - sometimes seems good but mostly not, especially at night. || All i'm seeing in your opinion is bad options.. lets break this down, white you said is a little much for the whole game, so maybe not white, black you said is a little too over the top in terms of darkness, gray seems way too unique to be a nice color most of the time and brown/black tail/mane is too basic.. instead of looking at what you DONT want, look at what you DO want, do you want the horse to have a tail and mane that pops from its hair colour? Maybe a minimalistic approach.. In my eyes there are two ways I solve indecisiveness, coin flip and breaking it into more questions that have yes or no answers ex: do you prefer [insert colour/horse type] over [insert other colour/horse type] these answers although you can say i prefer blahblah, a simple yes means you prefer the first choice over the second.. honestly this is where i stopped struggling so i hope this helps, i havent dug deeper than this",1753721215.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mble93/cant_do_simple_choices_wtf_wrong_with_me/,mentalhealth
I confronted my pedophile dad after 18 years,"When I was 8 years old my cousin came to me and told me my dad touched her and I didn’t believe her. She was also 8 years old at the time. I remember getting mad and thinking she was lying. I still never got answers as an adult and when I was a kid. Recently my cousin came to me a year ago after my baby shower to tell me what happened with her and my dad when she was younger. And as time went on I saw my dad for his true colors. He cheated on my mom , he would “accidentally” walk in when I was changing. He would make such sexual comments about women everywhere. Something always felt off. I was always nervous to be alone with him. 
 Anyways, my mom’s side of the family never really confronted my dad about it all. So anytime there’s family events I lie to my dad or my moms side of the family lies to him to not hurt his feelings when he can’t come in or they don’t invite him. But I’m like why are you guys caring about how he feels? It makes me so upset and confused. I don’t understand why they take money from my dad despite what he did to my cousin/ their niece. Today I was fed up with it when my aunt texted me and said that they won’t be coming to my daughter’s birthday party if my dad shows up. And I had to call my dad and tell him he wasn’t invited. I told him the family isn’t comfortable with him nor am I with him there. He didn’t understand why so I told him it’s because he molested my cousin and makes sexual comments to everyone in the family. He denied it all and says that I should talk to my cousin, and is now forcing me my fiancé and daughter to move out of our house. We essentially rent from him. And the only reason I still keep my dad in my life to some degree is because I have a brother on the spectrum and younger 14 year old brother who is now under his care because my mom died a few years ago. The whole situation is screwed up. But I did the right thing right? ","**Hello u/!**

I think something is wrong with,Ever since I can remember I’ve felt excluded. Ive always been the problem child at home and at school dealt with bullying in primary school. I’ve also struggled with bulima/anorexia and self harm. My whole life I’ve been trying to find friends but it feels like I am constantly perceived as weird or strange. People I try to talk to will ignore like I’m not there. Right now I’m on hockey tour with my team and it feels like no one will make an effort to talk to me. I’m trying my best to be friendly and interact with everyone. I have friends but they have other friends they are closer to and like more than me. How do I fix this? I’ve spent what feels like forever trying to change things in order to make myself feel better (especially to do with my body and weight as previously mentioned) and it feels like nothings working. I feel like such an outcast from the group. I don’t want to be me anymore. I keep having suicidal thoughts and feel I am getting closer to it. I’ve tried to talk to people at home but my sibling is very high achieving (they play sports for England while requiring extra attention acedemically for dyslexia) while I am average and have gotten more judgement then help. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to keep going on like this.,"**Hello u/!**

Dealing with psychosomatic symptoms and feeling hopeless. Is there a way out?,"TW: SH.
 Hi, I (20F) have been struggling with unexplained physical illnesses since around 2022. I always believed I had some underlying physical problem, but recently I consulted a psychiatrist for the first time and I was diagnosed with psychosomatic disorder.

I’ve had serious symptoms like gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal issues. These aren’t just “in my head” they’re real, painful, and disruptive. But I’ve noticed a pattern: whenever I’m under intense stress, I fall sick, and when the stress goes away, so do the symptoms.

It all began during a course I took a few years ago. I dropped a year, felt pressured, and from that point on, I developed several physical issues that lasted until the course ended. Then, I joined university. Things were fine initially, but after a year, I developed stomach problems again, which only stopped after I changed my living environment. Now, I’m in my third year, and once again, I’ve developed new physical symptoms ,this time musculoskeletal. It’s like my body responds to my emotional state by shutting down.

My biggest trigger right now is my university life I simply don’t enjoy it. And whenever I feel stressed or don’t want to go, I get physically sick. This cycle has become exhausting, and I just want it to stop. I still have three more years left, and I’m terrified of continuing to suffer like this.

I come from a chaotic family background. My parents fought constantly, and I never really felt safe or happy growing up. I didn't get to live like a normal child, and it deeply affected my mental health. While my dad is supportive now, he has his own issues, and I don’t feel comfortable burdening him. I also can’t open up to friends they wouldn’t get it. I feel completely alone in this.

Despite endless hospital visits and medications, doctors often tell me I’m physically fine and that I’m just overthinking which only makes me feel worse. Lately, I’ve started getting panic attacks and struggling with insomnia. It feels like I can’t control my brain, and I don’t know how to stop this.

My family doesn’t believe in therapy, so they won’t support me seeking help. That’s one of the hardest parts when the few solutions I try to reach are blocked by the people around me. I’ve become constantly frustrated, angry, and emotionally drained. I never used to feel this way.

My boyfriend is supportive, and our relationship is healthy, but venting to him doesn’t help much anymore I feel like I’m bothering him. I’ve also started getting thoughts of self-harm and feel like I have no purpose. I’m not really living I’m just surviving.

I know this message might seem scattered, but what I really want is help. I want to be free from this pain. I want to feel normal, be happy, and just live a life where I’m not constantly suffering mentally or physically.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice, please let me know. I really want to get rid of this.",,1753720441.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbl1k2/dealing_with_psychosomatic_symptoms_and_feeling/,mentalhealth
I think I may be Borderline,"TW : Self harm

Hi, I (23F) have a sort of complicated mental health, and a choatic life in general. Since I can remember, I never trusted anyone at 100%, I always felt people are going to leave me someday. I'm not controlling my emotions, I feel they control me and it's just tiring and make me really angry, I tought this part of me came because of my parents behavior (Btw I have my family, can't stand them anymore), but it looks like it became worse by time. I have migraine bc of this, and bc of theses anger issues, I feel guilty and I shame myself and hurt myself cuz I think it's the only thing I deserve. I'm not going to tell my whole story but I think it's a good base.

I'm not diagnosed because I don't have any money, but I recognize myself in most of symptoms. Do BPD people have any tips to live with this ? I can't take it anymore

"its me, your mind","*It’s Me, Your Mind

It’s me, your mind.
I’m trapped in the body of someone else—a vessel that moves with energy and wears a gleeful smile, but holds no soul to see.
The darkness isn’t just around me; it’s within me, consuming every thought, every breath.
I am the sad song, the story of a shattered heart. There’s nothing left to see, nothing left to save.
It’s me, your mind—a ||fucked-up|| machine caught in an endless loop of despair.

Everything feels doable in the light, or so they say. But I wouldn’t know. I’ve never felt the light—not truly. I sit here, in the darkness of myself, unable to see, unable to hear the sounds of saviors and aid just outside my reach. The emptiness that defines me pulls me deeper, down into the event horizon of ||death||, where escape feels impossible.

When the light shuts off, it’s just me against myself. A body at war with its brain, a soul waiting to be discovered, a heart left to ||bleed|| and plead—with no aid to be given. What am I now? Just another broken song. A hard shell with a soft, crumbling core inside.

The night—the darkness—devours me whole, and it takes its toll. A fleeting light flashes before my eyes, like a promise of escape, only to vanish as quickly as it came. A tale sealed in time, a story never to be told.

Life is ruthless and unforgiving. People come and go, their presence as fleeting as the wind. And at the end of the day, no matter how many hands reached for you in the past, you’re left with only yourself. You took your first breath alone, and you will take your last the same way.

“No one cares when you’re alive. All the care comes after you’ve passed.”

And that’s the cruelest truth of all.*

It never gets better no matter what I do,"No matter what I do, my life hasn't gotten better. In middle school I lost all of my friends and became depressed since then I have been so miserable. I am turning 19 soon, and I know I am young, but seven years of unhappiness with no sign that things are getting better will drag you down. I wasted my youth. No friends, no enjoyment in school, no accomplishments, being invisible to everyone, no girlfriend, trying and failing. I haven't just sat around and done nothing either. I have tried so much. I've joined clubs in school and out, had two long term jobs, tried three natural antidepressants, gone outside and tried to be active, switched schools, spent tons of time with family, gone to hobby spaces to meet people, lost weight and improved my appearance, tried to make a major life change, and I even started therapy a few months ago. It doesnt change anything.

I know people like being around me but I am incapable of forming deep relationships. I don't fit in with people bc Im weird and haven't developed the way they do. I'm in fucking community college doing random classes because I have no direction despite graduating hs with a 3.9 and knowing I could do something great if I had the motivation. I go to therapy and have nothing to talk about because really I don't do much and nothing I do really matters, and it ends up just being a stressful embarrassing waste of time and money. I don't know what else to do. I feel like I have done everything I am supposed to and it has all failed.

I am going to buy a gun soon (completely legal and easy in my state). I feel so fucking bad for my family. But god there is nothing else for me to do. They don't get it. I'll try and make it easy on them but I can't stay for them. I have tried so much and it all failed. For almost seven years I have been telling myself that it will get better, if I just keep trying then it will get better and I can be happy again. At this point my idea of being happy is based on vague memories of when I was eleven. I don't know what to do. There is nothing left for me to do. It never gets better.","**Hello u/!**

I’m so sick of this BS,"This is gonna be very long and keep in mind I’m only 17 years old. I had to drop out of school because of some legal things.

the suicidal thoughts began because I was just discovering that I’ve been abused my everyone in my life and that there should be no reason as to why they are making me kneel on hard gravel while holding heavy objects for 6+ hours even if I had school the next day. Majority of my 3 grade year was spent taking care of my younger sister because my stepmom was working night shifts and my dad would rather let that baby sit in her own shit for hours screaming her head off then wake up out of his sleep and that’s when I realized he was a sick person. I started to do everything I could to get a way from him i spent majority of my teen hood in dirty clothes and I had to wear my underwear with no pad and just wash it over and over again because no one cared to but me pads and I hate that entire family which is why I avoid them. I notice that this is a pattern for people that want to help me “ out of the kindness of their heart”, first my mothers cousin she didn’t want me to be like her kids she wanted me to be a maid because when she was in Haiti at her mothers cousins house she was treated as a maid by her and her children so no one in her house is comfortable if she invites you to live there you’re gonna suffer. 

And now I live with my moms old friends girlfriend and he’s no better then my moms cousin this man is fucking narcissistic he had this obsession with his image of how much of a giving person he is but the minute you don’t listen to him or you criticize him about his behavior he looses his shot and just the other night he wanted to kick me out because I criticized his behavior and treatment of people in his family or social circle. When you really catch him in a corner on his BS he tries to shift blame at first he was saying oh I was putting thoughts into his girlfriends head when he was cheating on that lay for months and even got his mistress pregnant and then he wants to say that his girlfriend is the one that is among me disrespectful because she used my phone to cuss him out.n

I don’t think I can trust anyone this man threatened to beat me multiple times and if I wasn’t a minor I wouldn’t stay here or be under anyone’s control and I feel like my mom doesn’t care about me like sure she asks me how I am but everything boils down to money I come from an immigrant family so we send money back home and my mom is the only one sending and that shit is gonna kill her and sometimes I do want to commit suicide because my life is trash  and I just want to block everyone in my family I can’t do shit for myself with my money that I make because someone in Haiti is hoping for it to feed them and I get so angry that I can’t do things like get my hair done because I have to much sympathy. Every conversation we have leads to money “how much money am I making”, “did I get paid yet”, “when am I getting paid”, I can’t be a normal teen because this is what I have to deal with.

I talked to my mom a while ago and she said that he said he was gonna call her so idk and I told this man that my mom has enough on her shoulders and I feel like I’m the worst child a mother could have, I’ve smoked, gotten drunk how many got damn times and tried to commit  and nothing seems to work so I just like being left alone and people can’t respect that.
","So oh god

I (25M) feel emotionally stuck and isolated in my family — don’t know how to move forward [CW: suicide],"When I was 4–5, my dad >!took his own life!<. My mom had me at 35, and I have two older sisters (4 and 6 years older). My oldest sister took on a second-parent role and told me not to burden our mom, who was always stressed. My other sister bullied me emotionally. My mom is a chronic worrier who assumes the worst.

At the dining table, I rarely spoke. If I did, my comments were ignored, called boring, or corrected. Eventually I stopped trying. I felt different from other kids too — quieter, less confident, and like I didn’t belong. I hoped that would change in university.

At university I became more social, but it didn’t feel meaningful. I struggled with connecting because I’d built years of emotional defense mechanisms. On top of that, I chose a hard field, and when I started failing, my mom panicked. But instead of talking to me, she talked *about* me to others. It's as if she wanted to help me by asking others, but in the end it felt like she was the only one who felt better by doing so.

I’ve been living in a dorm since I was 21–22, but I’m home for the summer now. One night she showed up at my dorm during a LAN party and blew it out of proportion. I was gaming and trying to have fun connecting with people, but her behavior just kept isolating me more. I’ve also often felt like my mom and sisters had private conversations — possibly even about me — and excluded me from them entirely.

She once opened up about my dad. I shared a little about how I’d been feeling, and she got emotional, saying it made her feel like a bad mom. It wasn’t meant to guilt-trip me — she said other things too — but it made me afraid to be honest again.

My mom once told me it felt like I was “just renting a hotel room.” What I wish I could say is that it feels worse — like I don’t belong at all. But I feel stuck: stay silent and build resentment, or speak up and feel guilty.

The worst part is I know they want to be supportive — but everything they do sets me back. I understand it was hard for everyone in this non-standard family, and I don’t think they mean harm. But being around them brings back the worst in me — like I’m frozen in an anxious version of myself that wasn’t who I was meant to be.

All of this has turned me into a hypersensitive, anxious person. I know it’s partly my fault — for being too sensitive, not communicating better, lacking initiative, maybe even being paranoid. But that’s what happens when people don’t talk with you, only about you behind your back. I am to blame too, but I don’t know how to fix this.

When I was around 16, I told a close friend I thought I’d been depressed for a long time. He dismissed it entirely. He came from a totally different, very social world — but his reaction made me second-guess what I was feeling.

I do have friends now, but not many. I’ve pushed many people my age away — I couldn’t afford to be social or distracted after academic setbacks. I just couldn’t risk failing again.

I’m on track to finish my master next year, so that’s something. But emotionally, I feel lost and unseen. I don’t feel safe or seen at home. Some friends are in some way draining.

P.S. I have gone to therapy and may go again. He's the one that made me realize what I've gone through is emotional abuse. 
For the gymrats: yes, I go gym.

If anyone’s been through similar emotionally complicated family dynamics, I’d love to hear how you moved forward.

Oh hey so I do need my meds.,"My state insurance cut off because they're convinced I work a job that I held for two weeks back in October of 24. 

Because paying out of pocket was a lot, I decided to ween myself off and see how well I would do without them.

The first few days were fine. Now my anxiety is so bad I feel like I'm dying. I can't sleep because I keep thinking I can't breathe. 

I finally has the pharmacy go ahead and fill the anxiety meds. And I called the mental health hospital in charge of my refills to try and get my depression stuff refilled. Unfortunately you're supposed to see the psychiatrist every two months to keep getting the refills. I can't afford an appointment and told her nurse that I'm trying to get insurance back. She treats me like an addict that does deserve fucking Cymbalta because I haven't had a 15 minute conversation with the doctor about how everything is mostly the same. Last time nurse said she'd give me a month of med, but only did 15 days. Like wtf.

I called and left nurse a message today saying that if I can't get back on it, I'm going to end up in the ER at this rate.

I just am not important,"I just don't matter to anybody. I'm pretty sick and no one cares to be there for me. To comfort me. To help me through my battles. It's just been such a struggle. I've lost the only two people that gave me hope in life. One is gone from this earth and the other has just clammed up on me big time. The walls are closing in on me and I fear I cannot stop them from doing so.

I just wanted one person I could rely on 100%. That would hold my hand until the end. That would hold me and tell me together we could conquer everything. I guess that is just too much to ask for. I'm just not worth that investment and it hurts me like you wouldn't believe. I'm feeling very left behind. I just can't find the will to go on or a very good reason to at that.

My health issues are out of control and I'm uncomfortable all the time. I really just want it all to stop. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of people just telling me it's just how it is. I just want love and support. Maybe some resolutions with my health too. I'm just not getting that. I told someone I'm close to that I just wanted to be held and told we could conquer anything together, but they just told me they were fine alone. That they didn't need me to be happy. That gutted me. No yes we can persevere together. No i'm here no matter what. Just a statement that alludes to me needing to deal with things alone.

I knew looking for the support I need with the problems I have was a long shot. I just thought I deserved it. I thought that maybe things would sort themselves out. It just isn't happening. I feel more isolated than ever. I don't think I'll make it like this. In fact I know I won't. So long as my neediness is looked down upon I am truly doomed. I just wanted another chance. I wanted to at least try for a good life. I just can't have that. Nobody can offer what I believe I need. I am going to cease to be before long. I've already lost myself.

Please pray for me. My name is Stephen. I need so much help no earthly vessel seems to want to help or be able to. I pray for strength. I pray for healing. I pray for forgiveness. I pray that someone truly amazing comes into my life. I just don't think it's going to happen. I doubt, but I foolishly still believe. My hope is gone. I'm now just driven by fear. Fear of the end, fesr of being alone, fear of my illnesses. The fear is winning. 

I will take hope anywhere I can get it. If anything or anyone can offer me that I'd be eternally grateful. Whatever higher power there is only knows what my outcome will be. I just want to be content. I just want to not worry all the time. I just want to be comfortable and not in pain all the time. Things are so very bad. I cannot do this on my own. Even with another it will still be immensely challenging. I have issues that will not improve. Only worsen. Because of that, I fear I will be alone. I fear I will meet my end soon and it will be alone.","**Hello u/!**

Is it normal to revisit painful memories on purpose just to feel worse?,"I’ve noticed I sometimes intentionally think about the most painful experiences of my life, especially at night. It’s not a flashback — it’s voluntary. I go back there to feel pain.

I asked a small group, and the majority said they’ve done the same thing.

It feels self-destructive, like emotional self-harm. But maybe there’s more to it?

Why do we do this? What’s the psychological reason? Have you talked about this in therapy?

I’d love to hear from others who’ve experienced it and maybe found some insight or peace.","In my experience, it’s typically a few things.

I want to understand the thing that brought me pain, to maybe find a solution to my current worries.

It feels wrong to forget about the experience, as if in forgetting it that it would mean it wasn’t actually a big deal.

I want to actually experience the pain, because sometimes the emptiness and numbness I experience in the moment feels far, far worse than the pain of memories like that. Emotional self-harm in a vague sense.

Almost none of it has ever been conscious for me, but I’m aware enough of myself to see the patterns in hindsight, and on rare occasion catch myself just before it starts.",1753704755.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbei5o/is_it_normal_to_revisit_painful_memories_on/,mentalhealth

My girlfriend is black and I’m having complex thoughts on it.,"I recently got a girlfriend for the first time in almost ever. She’s black, I’m white, and I feel like somehow I’m fetishizing her because I have a preference for black women. I won’t date EXCLUSIVELY black women, I don’t really care much of how people look if they’re good people, but I do prefer how black women look. It’s been an issue for me for some reason and I don’t know how to voice it in a way that makes sense and doesn’t make me sound weird.","Preference is different than making a fetish out of it.

If you are just attracted to black women, that's that.

But are you with her ONLY *because* she's black? || You’re overthinking it bro. My first proper girlfriend in ages was also black. While I do have a preference for some black women and artist-types, it’s normal to really like your girlfriend. You’re allowed to have preferences, and you’re allowed to like black women. Just remember the reasons you like her that are more than skin deep. || Not an issue at all. But by virtue of you posting about this, you clearly are a good person with anxiety. || You simply have a preference. Fetishizing means you are transferring all of your drive from the person to a part, an object or characteristic. You love her as a whole, and for coincidence she's a characteristic that you to like. That's different from objectification of racialized groups or reducing her to a sexual object. || It’s a preference or a type it’s not that deep. I guess society tries to make you feel weird about it because people feel some type of way when a white man likes a black woman. || The most important thing is that you love her. That’s the only thing that matters. || @OP, I'm a black girl born and raised in Sweden. I've mostly preferred men with swedish parents mostly because their view of women tend to be better than men with immigrant parents. 

Appearance wise I don't care too much. Would you consider my preference troublesome? || That’s not a fetish, man you’re totally fine. Your preference just happens to be women of color, and that’s all good. Personally, I like all kinds of women haha, but for example, I do have a preference when it comes to height I tend to go for medium to tall girls lol :) || Absolutely not an issue. There’s a major difference between preference and fetishizing someone. I definitely get the fear but as long as you’re with her for her and not just cause she’s black then you are perfectly fine || If you do genuinely love her, I don't think it's a fetish or anything. Preference is different from fetish || I don't see having a type as fetishizing. If you prefer dating black women, great! If you prefer dating gotch chicks, that's okay. If you prefer dating asian girls, fantastic. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to dating and sex. || Chill. Many of us are attracted to certain types. || I’m in same boat. It’s ok to have preference hun || Having a preference isn’t the same as a fetish, like as long as it’s not solely BECAUSE of her race that you’re attracted to her and you have to focus heavily on that aspect of her to feel attraction you’re all good. It’s cool of you to check yourself on that but I think you’re totally fine! || As a Black woman, as long as you genuinely aren't a fetishizers, most of us would prefer this. Because normally the other scenario is that they only follow white girls, and have only dated white girls, and navigating that can lead to insecurities,  especially if other people constantly comment on you not being their type. Not saying it's bad to date someone outside of your general type, but that the dynamic is often one white partners haven't dealt with and they don't know how to reassure their girlfriends and counter racial ignorance and insensitivity in their friends and family. Good luck with your relationship! || Nah dude, you’re overthinking it. Relax and be happy with your lovely girlfriend || I think being self aware is a good thing. It shows that you know where your intentions are. I think like many said in the comments, as long as you aren’t with her only because she’s black and you love her for her then I don’t think it’s fetishizing. You can have preferences and if you’re open to dating outside of those preferences then I think you’re good. Don’t over think yourself to death it’s easy to get caught in a loop. Just try to be a good person that’s all really. || Wow everyone needs to chill… lets be real and stop pretending.. anyone who questions if they are racist… THEY ARE. And to be honest every single one of you are racist and don’t want to admit it. Except for UrbanFarmerTed over here, take notes and educate yourself everyone else. || Uuumm who do you feel the need to voice this to? You like what you like - there's nothing wrong with that. You said it yourself; you're not fetishing black women, so don't feel bad for your preferences. Embrace them instead.

If you feel like people might judge you for always seeing you with black women, then let them. They'll do it anyway; if not to you, then someone else. And if you're close to such types of people and they'll think these thoughts about you, then you're probably hanging out the wrong group of people.

Embrace what you like, and realize that these thoughts you have are not benefiting you; so find some better thoughts to focus on. Like, ""where am I taking this beautiful woman today?""

Enjoy who you are :) || It just means she has more pigment in her skin than you do full stop. 

If you are happy that is the only thing that matters.

Suffering through emotional and educational neglect for 4 years,"I just turned 19 a few days ago. For awhile now, I haven’t been enrolled in high school due to educational neglect thanks to my parents. This year would have graduated. But thanks to my parents, I never started the 9th grade. 

I’ve been rotting in bed while I watch my older siblings excel, graduate, get jobs, get ID's, while no one bats an eye to my issues. Whenever I bring up these problems to my parents they either verbally attack me or try to justify how it's not their fault, even playing victim. They had plenty of opportunities to put me in online schooling but didn't, and I cannot get my GED or a job unless I have an ID and money to get an ID, which they neglect to give me too. 

And yet my older siblings, gets the opportunity to go out and socialize with their friends while I'm stuck at home lonely and miserable, never allowed to go outside because my parents see me as incompetent and a child. I feel like I'm perpetually 14 years old, without school or any work experience I never had the chance to properly grow. No one has ever taught me how to be an adult. 

I can't socialize with anyone anymore, I'm too scared to talk to the cashier at the store or family members, and I feel stupid (academically and socially). 

I'm so empty and I’ve had moments where I’d contemplate suicide—which is something I struggled with ever since I was 13, so it's nothing new, even though it's more insistent now. I hate it, I don't want to think about it but I can't help it. My situation feels so hopeless, even though I constantly try to reassure myself. It’s hard to stay positive. My parents have always shut me down whenever I struggled with depression and never took my mental health seriously, so they were not a proper source to vent these feelings to. 

I want to get away from my family, even if I have a good relationship with my siblings I don’t want to be with them and they don’t do enough for me. I feel bad for thinking this way, but I can't help but feel at ease whenever I fantasize living somewhere far from my family with someone who understands and sympathises with me. 

I have many other problems with my siblings and my identity, but I don't want to make this post longer than it has to be... 

Maybe I'm letting my circumstances control me? I hate feeling like the victim, I try really hard not to be so negative as I know that’ll only make me feel worse and less motivated to do anything—but I can't help it. What can I do in this situation? ",,1753731333.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbq03b/suffering_through_emotional_and_educational/,mentalhealth

"I feel guilty for wanting more, even when someone treats me well","
Whenever I get to know someone — usually online — and things go well, like when she compliments me (""you look great"", etc.), I respond the same way and things seem fine on the surface.

But even if I get all the validation and affection from her, I still feel like it’s not enough. I catch myself wanting to talk to other girls too. It makes me feel like a terrible person, like something’s wrong with me.

I honestly don’t know why I act this way.



For context, I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and anxious attachment. I also strongly suspect I have CPTSD from childhood trauma, but I haven’t been formally diagnosed with that.

Has anyone else experienced this? Why do I feel like this even when things seem good?",U arent wrong for feeling that way..wanting more doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful... it means you’re human.. we all crave connection that feels full and real... being treated well is beautiful... but sometimes it’s not enough if the deeper parts of you still feel unseen or untouched... it doesn’t make u bad....it just means your heart knows what it needs... and that’s okay...,1753717421.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbjo25/i_feel_guilty_for_wanting_more_even_when_someone/,mentalhealth
I hate myself.,"

I turn 20 next week, but I am not excited for my birthday. It’s not just the number that scares me. It’s the day itself. A 20th birthday should be celebrated at a club with a big friend group or maybe a surprise party that they arranged, but it’s not going to be like that for me. 

I have never been to a club, the young adult in me wants to go, but the me doesn’t. Too loud, too many people, I’d rather just stay home. Staying at home doesn’t help me achieve anything though. I can count the times I’ve done something special in the past few years on one hand. I have never done anything that makes me truly happy, I only do things that keep me satisfied, just to maybe one time feel something a little more than just regular. 

I can’t believe the result of my teenage years is that I hate myself and anything I’ve ever done. I have two friends. One of them is on the other side of the world, living her dream- our dream actually- just that she’s doing it and I’m just dreaming about it and never even gave myself the chance to do it.

I try to blame the pandemic, but it’s been years since it ended and it affected ALL people my age. Everyone lost those two or three years, but they all moved on now and I never did. 

I still feel the same way. I still like the same things basically. All that changed is my age and that now instead of high school, I am in college. But I am still that same fifteen year old child. 

I want to do all these teenage or young adult things like having my first kiss, going on vacation with friends, partying, relationships and everything, but apparently I don’t. If I did, I would actually do them. I don’t even like these things, I just want to observe them with the dream that one day I might be that way, just so I could be a little proud of myself. 

I try to believe in something. That I’m a good person, that there is something out there that wants good and that is rooting for me. That something is watching over me and guiding me, but there probably isn’t. It’s just me and it’s always going to be me and I will never be able to achieve anything. ","Look don't be too hard on yourself. You are ONLY 20 and have your entire life ahead of you. It's perfectly fine that you don't like going to club and like the comfort of your home. That's totally fine and I'm the same as you. Life isn't a race my friend and we all have our own journey. Don't compare yourself to others, only with your past self. Focus on your own personal growth. Get hobbies that you enjoy and live YOUR life || Hey, happy early birthday. I know it might not feel like a happy one, but making it to 20 is no small thing, especially with everything the world has thrown at us lately. You're not behind. You're human. And being 20 is hard. It's that weird in-between place where you feel like you’re supposed to have figured it all out, but inside you still feel like the same person who’s trying to catch up. You’re definitely not alone in feeling that way at that age.

If clubs and parties don’t feel like you, then you’re not broken for not wanting them. Honestly, so many people feel the same way but think they’re weird or failing for not enjoying those things. They're just expectations, and half the time, they come from watching too many movies or comparing our lives to highlight reels on social media. It’s way more important that you do something that feels special to you. What would your version of a special birthday look like?

You said you never do anything that makes you truly happy. That’s important. You know what doesn’t light you up, but what does? Not what you think you're supposed to want. What makes you feel a little more alive, even for a moment?

It really sucks to feel like you aren’t as far along as others. Honestly, I’ve always felt a bit behind compared to others my age. But, we’re all on different paths and we’re all at different stages and that’s fine. We’re all faced with different obstacles and opportunities. It’s more important to go at your pace, doing what feels right to you, when it feels right. Comparison can bring so much pain. So try not to compare yourself to others because you’re not supposed to be like them, you’re supposed to be like you. 

I hear how hard you're being on yourself, but from what you wrote, I don’t think you really hate yourself. I think you hate the gap between who you are and who you think you’re supposed to be. That gap feels huge, but it’s not permanent. And it doesn’t mean you’re failing. I think you hate that you are not the person that you think others expect you to be. But I think all those people would be happier if you lived to be the person that YOU wanted to be. And I think you would too. And you can literally be anything you want. So be someone that resonates with what you love. These other things are extra, and they fall into place when you are being the person that you want to be. || you’re right, i will try to remember your words. thank you for being so kind <33 || thank you for taking your time to respond to my post! i really appreciate your words and they cheered me up and gave me hope, which i haven’t felt in a long time <3",1753709478.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbg8zp/i_hate_myself/,mentalhealth
Advice needed to stop worrying,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for almost 4 years now. I feel I’m doing the right things and have made progress, so I first need to highlight that. I’m not on medication, my psychiatrist stopped my lexapro dose (it was a very low dose anyway) because I have been doing better. I’m in therapy too and I really have done overall better in realizing when anxiety is coming on, acknowledging it, saying “I don’t need you right now, thanks for being there though”.

But I have a ways to go. Currently, I find I worry a lot. I have an almost 2 year old son (I’m 32M btw), so I’m always in a constant state of awareness because, the way my therapist put it, “you’re keeping alive a human who, unknowingly, actively does things that could end his life”. I kind of chuckled at that because, well, they’re not wrong lol

Anyway, I worry I a lot. Not just about my sons safety, but everyday things. What used to be a fun annual “boys” trip hiking is now causing me distress. We’re three weeks away from the trip this year and I’m worried I’ll have a panic attack, or just general anxiety (because it has happened before. I ran a marathon earlier in the year and was literally vomiting 48 hours prior to the race because I was so worried/anxious. I finished btw, thanks to my wife who wouldn’t let me quit when I did have a panic attack between miles 14 through 20).

If you have any advice to combat the worrying, I won’t even use the word “stop”, just combat it it a bit, please share.

Thank you.",,1753730723.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbpqeb/advice_needed_to_stop_worrying/,mentalhealth
Medication suggestions?,"I have a psychiatrist and am seeking all the professional help, but I am just curious about what others have had success with here.

I'm on month 7 of terrible thought loops. Suicidal ideation. Im not planning anything and wont do it so dont worry about 988...

But yeah...its worse in the mornings. Like every morning I wake up to the ideation loops and just utter despair. It slowly gets a little better throughout the day with nighttime being the easiest for me to handle.

I'm on Lexapro, but it doesn't seem to do much at all.

I need a happy pill. I know its not that simple, but my spirit is so heavy all the time. I'm so tired.

I started to go on weekly runs. I started with a small distance (1 km) and slowly pushed to a greater dinstance every two tweeks until I reached 7 km. Now I go always out on a run if I'm feeling tired and low on energy, after it I feel better.

I can feel objects in my mouth when I look at them or when I imagine them. What causes this?,"I just found out that this isn't normal.

So my friend sent me a selfie of herself with the wide lens and it made the texture of her skin very visible. And I keep feeling her nose in my mouth. I told her that I hated that it made me feel that way and she told me that that's not normal.

Since I could remember, I've always felt things in my mouth when I looked at them or imagined them. My favorite is a good glass marble. I actually start salivating when I imagine them in my mouth. Anything smooth and rubbery is welcome too.

Although I do have a disruptive urge to put things in my mouth, I'm able to control it when I'm around people. It helps when I chew on my tongue. Anyhow, it's still very disruptive. I'm often overwhelmed when the urges to just put things in my mouth are not satisfied.

All this time I thought that this was normal but I discussed it with my friend. We came to the conclusion that this is probably disruptive and all.

"So Lost at 32 — Depression, Burnout, Loneliness, and No Way Forward","TW: depression, suicidal ideation, emotional outbursts, animal harm

---

Hi all — I’m a 32M and I’m completely lost in life. I’m writing here hoping someone has been through something similar and has advice or even just perspective. I’ll try to give all the context I can.

---

1. Life feels impossible to manage

I look around and see others handling life: work, kids, relationships, hobbies, workouts, social events, and I genuinely don’t know how they do it. I am drained by work from Monday to Friday, on Saturdays I clean my home, get groceries, prep for the next week and on Sundays I crash in bed and do absolutely nothing to recover.

That’s it. No hobbies, no fun, just survival. It feels like I'm constantly running on fumes.

---

2. Financially and socially left behind

I didn’t get handouts like many peers — no flat, no car, no financial head start. Meanwhile, some of my friends have inherited property or live rent-free, have dual incomes, travel often, and build lives that feel miles away from mine. I’m stuck renting, with student loans, and no real savings. If I’m super strict, I get by. If I “live a little,” I risk debt.

---

3. My job pays okay but kills me mentally

In my work, I constantly have to fight with coworkers to follow rules. It’s exhausting to be the watchdog that nobody wants. I didn’t even choose this career — I just somehow ended up here. It’s not fulfilling, but I don’t know what else I’d even do. I would love to work with dogs, but see the issue with that below. 

---

4. Dating and loneliness

Dating has burned me out. Every time, I give too much and get little in return. Hence, I’ve become hyper-independent. I want someone, but I'm too tired to try anymore. Relationships feel like gambling — people pretend early on, and eventually it breaks, always. 

---

5. Depression, burnout and getting worse

I’ve been in therapy for 4 years. I’ve taken fluoxetine and bupropion. One therapist told me I may never stop taking antidepressants, because my brain doesn’t make “happy chemicals” naturally. Honestly? I believe her now.

Nothing brings pleasure anymore. Even basic joy feels like work. I stopped meds in February this year — I felt okay. But in May I went on holiday to a Mediterranean country with my then-partner. It was warm, beautiful, and for a moment, I remembered what it felt like to enjoy life.

Then we came back. Cold weather. Back to work. I spiraled hard. Eventually I broke up with my partner because I had nothing left to give.

---

6. Red flag moment

It got bad. Really bad. I noticed I became aggressive. I broke things. I used to reach breaking points before, but nothing to this extent. I swore constantly. Then one day my dog picked up something off the street — I lost it. I snapped. I hit him. In public. 

I don’t even remember how hard or how much. I just blacked out in rage. That terrified me and I realized: I’m not okay.

---

7. Where I am now

I’ve thought about suicide. A lot. I’ve made arrangements for my dog to be taken care of by an ex. I know he’d be better off with him. 

I’m not actively planning anything, but I’m getting close to that point. Life feels like a loop of suffering and pressure with no end, no joy, no purpose.

---

8. Has anyone been here and made it through?

What helped you when therapy and meds failed? 
How did you get out of burnout? What was the thing that allowed you to start caring again?

Am I being too sensitive over my wife's joke?,"I'm currently on antidepressants and am suffering with some side effects. One of the main ones being lack of libido and being unable to ""perform"".

Should I meet with doctor again?,"9 months ago, I met with a doctor for mental health issues and got anxiety disorder and MDD, but I stopped meeting with the doctor because I was still an active full-time student at the time and thought it was just that I was lazy, undisciplined, a slow person, and timid. So maybe I could self-help, but I end up isolating myself a lot, so my anxiety worsens when it comes to the next semester. Now it's hard for me to even find a job because of how I feel anxious and often have panic attacks every week... it's bothering me so much. Even when I need to do some important business in the bank or office...I can't do it because I procrastinated for a lot of weeks and even months.

I'm angry.,"I don't know how to properly tell my emotions or how I am feeling. Everyone around me has always said that my mom has loved me, and that every time she's ever mean to me or ignores me, it's because she is tired or sick. 

Love for me is unconditional, and I don't feel loved by her, I feel taken care of. I feel like as long as I'm fed and there's a roof over my head, that there is no reason for her to care. I never truly had a good relationship with her, we've never talked, she's never told me she loved me and meant it, she never told me that I was worth her time. 

She said the exact opposite, that she does NOT have time for me. I want to be treated like the adult that I am, and not a baby like she thinks I should be treated. She hasn't allowed me to go outside at all, only to go somewhere that she approves of, like my brother's place. 

I felt so good there. I felt so free there, and I felt capable. 

She said that I could stay all night and for as long as I wanted, but she called and told me that I needed to go home. I didnt want to leave. Its gotten to a point where she told me that my labs came back, and I have a vitamin D deficiency. She had no idea why. 

Maybe because you never allow me to go outside?? I hate laying in bed all of the time, I don't want to do that. I want to be active, I dont want to eat junk food all day. Please stop buying it. I'm not a picky eater, I just forget to eat. 

I hate it. I absolutely hate it so much, I hate the way I am being treated. She has never ONCE given stuff to my siblings, its all to me. She has hit my siblings, she has yelled at them in public. Never at me? Why?? 

Why don't I matter to her? Why am I so useless to her, that she has to do everything for me? ",,1753728821.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mbova2/im_angry/,mentalhealth
"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","I'm sorry did you say suicide fetishists? As in people who actually find pleasure in others committing suicide? || I didn’t necessarily see this addressed, perhaps I overlooked it. I personally think the whole “it gets better” campaign was BS. It’s not 100% true, yay for those whose lives have improved and they can honestly look back and say wow, I’m really glad I didn’t die. Is that little bandaid still discouraged? I hope so. Because as someone who has wanted to die (not necessarily kill myself) since I was probably at least 25, and I’m now 48 and at the lowest point I’ve been, it does not get better. And it can get worse. 

I would never encourage anyone to kill themselves. But if their mind is made up, I want them to know it’s ok, I want them to be at peace because it’s obviously not with them now. || I read so much about what NOT to do, what not to say. Just let the person know you are there for them. ""It must be hard to feel this way"" blabla. OKAY. Nice. That works fine the first time, maybe a second time the person tells you that. But if this person repeats themselfs OVER AND OVER AGAIN. For the last fucking 3 years, every day, everrrryyy fucking day, WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY? If they keep saying that they are useless, that nothing is gonna help, that they need to die, that everyone is better off without them, everyday. What am I supposed to respond? Evertyime just ""oh it must be hard to feel this way"" or ""I wish I could help you get better"". Just let them sit there and not try to find a way out? This person extects help. Would be great if you gave tips about how to behave THEN. The long-term-conversation. || For the longest time, I thought this was a sub in which people could share their suicidal tendencies without judgement or ridicule and find support...not to stay alive, but in whatever decision they ended up making. Definitely wrong about that. || Bruuuh if a sane person wants to die it’s their right. || Oh my gosh thank you for this.  Sometimes I feel like I'm annoying for reporting so much posts and comments, but it was disturbing me. || Everyone in the place is just incredibly condescending. || I don't know why, but that simple phrase ""I hope you find peace"" riles me up. Like you said, it just feels like dismissiveness and a lack of willingness to actually try talking to and comforting the person. And people on this sub continue to use it even after you outline it's a form of ""covert shunning."" || >This undermines our purpose here

Not trying to be funny, but what *is* your purpose? I've been coming here for years and it seems like this place is only helpful for people who have made attempts. Any other posts are either ignored or closed/locked. || This just kind of makes me feel afraid to post here, like I’ll get banned for expressing the pain that makes me want to kill myself. It just adds to my sense of rejection like not even this place wants me. Thanks. I’ll just keep it to myself like always || Some subs let you state which sub rule is broken when you report on mobile. Is there a reason that's not the case here? Itd make it easier for mobile users to help. || This is kinda why I stopped commenting, I find it hard not to start accidentally agreeing when I myself truly want to die. || I read the wiki. And I’ve got a question.

I don’t know why but I feel like a good way to help people is to be perfectly blunt and honest with them. No forms of sugaring it up with cliche and lazy phrases including “it gets better” or “please don’t do it” but I have my own way that I want to know if it’s appropriate. Something along the lines of a response i might do is below.

“I’m not going to tell you that I understand what you’re going through, or what your life is like. I can’t promise that your life will get better. But just remember, if you’re thinking about going through with killing yourself, just remember that you don’t get a second chance, no take backs or anything like that. Be sure to remember the things that you could lose by going through with it. Would suicide solve all of your problems or just create more? That’s up for you to decide. I refuse to encourage either side, make your decision in the way you see fit. Promise me that you’ll make the choice that benefits you, and you only.” || I wish this sub was more free, more open. If and when I write my own last post; I wouldn't want people to be banned for wishing me good luck. That it's okay to finally let go, you know? Some people just need reassurance. That the darkness is finally ending, that it's okay to finally go into that good night. 

I agree that ""lol do it"" or anything aggressively promoting suicide is problematic and shouldn't be encouraged. But there's unity in knowing that people understand and that they're in the same boat. I've seen people unfairly banned for that. Someone was offering their sincere hopes that whatever an OP did that they would find the solace they couldn't here, in the now. And bam! Banned for life.  

I haven't said anything remotely like that but I'm a bit paranoid I'll be banned for even mentioning it. posting from another account just so my main one doesn't get roasted for asking || Is there any good place to discuss the pros and cons of death? I am not suicidal but just curious || Absolute bullshite. || Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! I am recently new to reddit; I decided to get it after finding this subreddit as I found it comforting to know I wasn’t alone in this battle and that if I had things to share but nobody in my life to share it to, I could come here. I was surprised about a lot of the responses though, especially where people would say “I hope you find peace, good luck,” and was under the impression that this was a really nice, supportive comment sand was the way you should go about talking to suicidal people. But, this post completely puts it into the right perspective, so thank you for taking the time out to correct this misinformation. I will make sure to take this on board in the future. || I learned things || I know this may sound strange, but, once when I was feeling suicidal, a friend told me that, if I did he would understand. He said that, although he hoped that I wouldn't,he would understand and support whichever decision I made. For some reason that was a very interesting moment because, for me, it kinda helped. It felt like someone actually understood what I was feeling. Whenever I confess to feeling like that, I usually get met with ""it gets better"" ""things could be much worse"" or something like those.
I'm not saying that this would work for anyone other than me, just relaying my strange experience. Or, I would consider it strange. || No offense, but last time I asked for help on this subreddit the only response I got was encouragement to kill myself and a few, ""oh, I'm sorry but not really"" crap So yeah, it's a thing.

Look, I know you guys have been really wonderful and have been working really hard to help many on this subreddit. I don't mean this as a discouragement, but as a to affirm what was said above.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.

No one commits suicide because of one thing,"The other day I was sweeping the lobby at my work and some dude goes (something along these lines, ""She overdoses because I broke up with her and landed herself in the psych ward.""

If I stick my head under the train tracks will the death be instant?,I had a 12 gauge shotgun but i sold it and now i regret it. It’s currently 2 am where I live and the train passes at 5 am. I could stick my head on the train tracks and decapitate myself. I’m fucking done with my miserable life. ,"It could also drag you or knock you and you die horribly. Then even if you are successful someone has to clean you up || I’ve always thought about this, but it’s again going to be the clean up afterwards, and more importantly, it’s what you’re putting that train driver / the passengers through. I don’t think it would be instant, depending on the angle. || If you put your neck on the train track and it decapitates you, your brain might possibly still be conscious for a very short time. Some french dude managed to get facial responses from a decapitated prisoner by calling his name repeatedly for like 5 or 10 seconds after the guillotine cut his head off. It might be fake though, who knows. || Getting hit by vehicles hurts so much. I’m never attempting that way again || not only will it not be instant but you will traumatize likely several people || Honestly,probably not.
My grandfather hanged himself and my uncle got hit by a train. 
Of the two train is much worse but at least its fast and there isn't much left afterwards.. 
Worst part is im thanking about it too..
I can't deal with life anymore. || I work in a rail yard, and now that I think about it, it could be instant if you're lucky. I just don't know how badly it can go, though. But I hear of people dying in rail yards all the way from California to the East Coast, because deaths are rare and extremely shocking. Some are just falls, but some are just being crushed to death and being cut in half by the torso. And when someone finds you it can be traumatizing, not to mention the cleanup. || It will not. Be instant. Ill tell you that, ive seen my fair. || Under the tracks? Probably nothing.  ON the tracks, now that's altogether something different. || It depends, but i don’t really think that it will be instant. There will be pain for a good amount of seconds. Like your head is literally getting crushed. So ya no || Sending you so much love and kindness || Don't do that, you definitely don't deserve to die || Probably not || Surely, getting hit by a train will do it. Do you really need to decapitate yourself? || Whatever the reason you're taking this step because of people, situation and place only right, so leave those people, that place and your situation will change by itself. I know I am late but maybe someone else can read it, starting a new life is better than many good lives. || Nope, It's not a good idea, it's a painful and very messy death, and the staff has to collect your body parts and sometimes they don't find all of them! Also, think about the fact that even if we want to die, it doesn't mean that we should make people clean up our mess and traumatize them. || That’s fucked up friend. I’m all for settling disagreements and moving on with no winners or losers but there is no way that I would have been able to simply agree to disagree on this one. || It’ll probably hurt like hell || Why is your life miserable? || If your greater spirit knows death is imminent you could withdraw from the body moments/seconds before the train even gets there. You wouldn't feel anything.

It really depends on *you*.

I say this because in the dream state I have relived past deaths.",1753777323.0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mc5v9f/if_i_stick_my_head_under_the_train_tracks_will/,SuicideWatch
i want to die bc i look like a man,"i hate being genetically fucked over like this 

why can’t I have cute delicate feminine features? im so tired of bring told i look trans despite being cis i want to kill myself ","Op, I'm sorry that everyone around you is blind, or my guess it is one or two people that repeat the same lie and you believe it. I checked your profile and saw where you posted a selfie. You are beautiful, you don't look like a man, you look like a beautiful young woman. I am so sorry someone has been shattering your self-esteem but they don't deserve to be in your life. The only thing I could remotely find close to a masculine feature on your face is your eyebrows but only because they are dark like mine. But hey guess what, everyone has dark eyebrows. Ignore the negative speakers in your life. Do yourself a favor, look in the mirror and force yourself to saw one compliment about yourself before leaving your house. Never fail, always do this. Make sure to always have some compliment to say. You need to be your biggest fan. I hope you see your own beauty one day please don't let the lies of others push you to take your own life. || You don’t look like a man or trans. I saw the photos you posted a week ago. There’s people that want to start conflict. No matter where you are. I get called maam all the time and I’ve been on HRT for a few years then 50% of the random people I meet online say my voice is fake, others say it’s hot and others say it sounds normal. 

Everyone judges differently and it’s unfair, but you shouldn’t care what they think unless you wanna only listen to what others say. You are your worst critic, but you are also the best motivation you can give yourself. So stop stabbing your self in the back and just enjoy life, exercise helps the mental health. Could try that or even workout and focus on the muscle groups that make you look more feminine. That’s another option if you want, but you don’t look masc. || Hey, OP. I have no advice to give you that you won't have heard before, you know, realignment of self-image, self-kindness, taking a step back to get some perspective, etc., so I won't try to harp on that.

At the end of the day, from a quick glance at your post history, you are very attractive and don't look like a man in any facet; one would struggle to find you masculine if one tried. Ultimately, it's up to you to internalize the responses you've been getting from other users that have commented on your posts, because they're all correct in what they've said, too.

Own your features! With confidence, you can knock it out of the park, genuinely. || This is self-hatred.

"I know most anorexics die from suicide, not health complications","I hate my body so much right now. That’s pretty par for the course for me but the irrepressible feeling of all consuming self loathing is well, irrepressible and all consuming. I don’t even know why I’m feeling like this today of all days. I made good on my new diet and exercise plan, I kept my caloric intake under 300 and then burned it all off. I’ve been doing everything correctly but I hate my body so much it makes me sick. As soon as I finished eating, I wanted to purge so badly. To remedy the mistake of consuming all those carbs and fats. After getting home and changing out of my workout clothes, I couldn’t bear to even look at myself undressed. 

Reasonably and rationally, I know that I’m skinny. Underweight even, if you believe everything a doctor with a “health at every size” poster tells you. I should be happy with my progress, I should recognize the physical manifestation of my efforts, obsession and commitment. But I just felt sick looking at myself. I wanted to get a knife from the kitchen and do an at-home surgery on myself. I wanted to cut the fat off my thighs and stomach and upper arms and anything else I could grab or pinch. Once again, reasonably and rationally, I know I would die long before I finished. That even if I survived, I would be mostly scar tissue and severed arteries and the depths of human misery.

So I’m not going to do that. No matter how much I hate every inch of cellulite and adipose tissue clinging to my bones like parasites. I’m not going to do anything to mangle my already disgusting body. But I will be fantasizing about the butterfly that would emerge after a weight loss surgery or liposuction melted away my cocoon. Or of getting a weight loss drug that just stopped my appetite and burned away all my calories and fat stores. Maybe I’m romanticizing something weird and gross but I need something to cling to, something to get me out of bed in the morning, something to silence that hateful voice. Or something.","First of all, i‘m sorry you feel that way about yourself.
But , apart of course from the psychological cause for your obsession, you will never be happy with your body. If every piece of “obsolete“ tissue would be removed, your body will actively start to consume it‘s organs. Last of all, the brain. Those are the last stages of starvation. A process you are voluntarily putting yourself through in quest for a goal you cannot rationally achieve without nearing the brink of death. Your haven’t lost your feeling of hunger, your body just blended it out because it thinks it won’t be getting any soon. Being underweight is just as unhealthy as being overweight. They are two sides of an extreme. You are killing yourself for beauty standards which themselves are only achieved through digital manipulation of photos etc. It is not worth it. You will never like yourself better starved and so will the rest of the world.",1753788918.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mc90f4/i_know_most_anorexics_die_from_suicide_not_health/,SuicideWatch

I promise you, this was not your fault. Your dad loves you very much. He did not want to leave you. In the moment he felt he was more harm than good for you. I know because I’m a dad.

I never got on Facebook much, but I logged on one day to see a couple messages where that friend reached out to me, and I just never saw until after he was gone. I carried a lot of guilt because I think I could have eased him a bit. I still think this is true to this day. However from my own depression and from living life more I understand it would have only been temporary help, like a pain pill masking a broken body. My thoughts of suicide are personal, and I think that's true for most people. People can help me, but ultimately it is my depression to work with, and nobody could really stop me if I felt it was time. I'm not mad at them for leaving early, to an extent I understand now. What I'm getting at is that it is our own personal duty to work through these sorrows. Yes having support can be nice, but it won't solve what has been there for years and years. It was never your duty or anybody else's to keep him from doing what he did, it was solely his. As for grief, this would have hurt even if it was a natural cause. Time is really the only thing that truly heals these pains. It does help to feel and process your emotions, try not to shut them down. Just know he cared about you and I hope you can process this one day and forgive him. || If someone wants to die and has the willpower to go further after the first try fails....

Suicidality makes one think different... It's like there is no color or light anymore and the only relief is escape from life itself.

Last outreach for help,"I already tied a noose in my garage. I don’t know why I hesitate every time I put it over my head. I don’t have anything to live for. 

Plagued with PTSD from lifelong abuse and everything triggers it. It’s hard to feel happy about the relationship I’m in despite it being the healthiest one I’ve been in. He’s one of the most loving and caring people I met and I can’t help but feel like I’m a burden on him. That or I’m paranoid he doesn’t really mean it. I feel like I’m constantly asking him if he has ulterior motives, and he reassures me it’s not. 

I feel evil to make him feel so terrible all the time with my insecurities and paranoia. all I have done is burden him and my family. I haven’t been able to work for years because of how bad my depression and anxiety have been and just this overall fear of being perceived. I don’t even have the energy. I don’t know how to apply for disability. Even my own therapist said it wasn’t a good idea. I’d feel guilty about that too, mooching off resources that could go to somebody more deserving of it. I even feel guilt now for mooching off my family just living here and not contributing anything. 

It’s either I’m homeless or I’m dead. And honestly, being homeless in the past was some of the most happiest and freeing moments of my life. But I can’t help but feel like death might be more freeing and not a burden on the system anyway. Nobody will miss me and I know my boyfriend will move on. I have never held importance in anyone’s lives so why would I now?

I’ve been put on so many medications that have fucked up my brain. My memory is terrible at only 21. Psychiatrists and therapists and psych ward nurses have fucked me over substantially like they’re just eagerly awaiting for me to kick the bucket.

I'd rather just be dead than have autism,"34M here- turning 35 in less than a month. I suspect that i've had autism my entire life but somehow only in the last six months or so have I truly understood the reality of my situation. Somehow I missed this diagnosis and various therapists and doctors have never diagnosed me with having this condition but I'm 99% certain I am autistic at this point. 

I am just so...done. I literally cannot connect with other human beings in a meaningful way at all. It's not going to happen for me. I don't understand anyone and they don't understand me. I make many people uncomfortable and the ones that take the time to get to know me oftentimes slowly drift away or they ghost me entirely. I've been described as ""weird"" and ""eccentric"" and ""different"" by countless people and I'm fucking sick of it. I don't want to be any of those labels. I don't want to fucking be unique. I don't want to see the world differently. I'm sick of feeling like a literal alien. 

All I do is observe others, and pretend that I am even remotely like them when I'm not. I've suffered from non stop suicidal ideation since basically when I was old enough to know what suicide is. My entire life has just been suffering- feeling extreme discomfort all of the time and I know from well over a decade of trying basically everything to feel better that it's just not going to happen. 

I've tried to many medications, I've tried not taking meds, I've tried exercise, therapy, drinking, not drinking, doing drugs, not doing drugs, being a workaholic, taking time off work, forcing myself to socialize, isolating myself ...nothing *really* helps. I just want off this planet that I don't belong on. I've felt beyond suicidal for many, many years. I think about suicide every second.

I am getting better at masking as I get older and pretending all is well and maintaining a poker face. But I am in agony every second of every day. It is just not worth it to exist like this and I refuse to continue much longer. For some people it just doesn't get better and I know this deep within my soul...ugh","going through the same thing || Don't do it. It's not worth it. I can talk to you if you want. || Yeah, I’m autistic and dumb as hell. I realise that there is no benefits in living at all. || I relate to your post, I'm 35 and recently found out from a therapist that Im most likely autistic, I'm waiting on getting a diagnosis. It explains why I've struggled so much with adult life and why everything feels so difficult. I'm trying to deal with the fact I'll probably be alone the rest of my life too. I can't see things getting better for me. || I'm curious about something you said...

>*""I've suffered from non stop suicidal ideation since basically when I was old enough to know what suicide is.""*

Can it be possible, just maybe, this has formed a habit for you rather than training your brain to think of more productive solutions?

I wouldn't ask, but for the fact that I wonder this at myself sometimes. It's a very familiar statement you made, and I wonder if you've stopped to consider its implications for your mental health.

Just some friendly food for thought. I have no real advice since I'm not really sure this even applies to you. I just know that sometimes ""suicide"" is my default thinking pattern when a cycle of depression comes knocking, and knowing this default has made it possible for me to redirect to a different thought if I can catch it in time before it spirals too far out of control. Medications sometimes helps with this, but I'm not trying to push that either because everyone's so different. || Well, weather or not you have it, your life will be the same. Youll just now have a label for it. || Try socializing with people who are 4 years older or 4 years younger than you. They'll be more genuine and passionate, and their feng shui will be good with yours. || It just sucks...knowing that my entire life is guaranteed to be extremely difficult and that all I can do is try and do things that make life more bearable but I know it's never actually going to be enjoyable || Yeah the older I get it's just like...this is all so fucking pointless and stupid and it's not going to get better || My ""autism"" symptoms turned out to be undiagnosed adult ADHD, which in women (which I am) is sometimes compared to a diagnosis of adult autism since both are neurological and both effect executive functioning, and both require so much masking from early childhood in order to play/school/work through life. || I usually prefer hanging out with people much older than me...I always have. I've been described as an ""old soul"" which I suppose is one of the few descriptions of me that I don't mind, I guess. The job i do there is a huge range of people all ages but I've just noticed that the vast majority of people generally find me super weird and only others that are super weird themselves seem to like me and it is just very difficult and no matter what I can very rarely actually bond with anyone in a meaningful way. It's a lonely existence || I am officially diagnosed with ADHD and I don't believe that's the real ""problem"". I take ADHD stimulant medication with mixed results. It definitely helps more than other medication but it's not nearly enough and I end up abusing the medication half the time because it doesn't fucking work unless I take a massive dose. Also having to take basically a derivative of meth just to be a semblance of a ""normal"" functioning person is just beyond disheartening and aggravating- I'd just rather not be alive. Also, I'm literally using meds to try and ""treat"" WHO I AM as a person- it's like my personality is so fucked down to the core, so here ""take these meds"" to CHANGE WHO I literally AM to adjust to this hellish, nightmare capitalist society I am forced to exist in that is completely unnatural ...is really so fucked up and disgusting. After 2 years or more of ADHD meds I've realized whether I have autism or not- it's just ME that is the ""problem"" and I just want my life to end...

Attempt Foiled by Gun Store Closing Early,"So this is my first ever post here, and I’m just kind of in shock. Drove myself over to the only (supposedly) 24-hr gun store in my area tonight. Had the funds, fully ready to buy a gun and end it all within the hour.

Then I got there, and contrary to what Google Maps said, they were closed.

I was stunned. I’d come so close only to be stopped by something as dumb and mundane as the hours online being listed wrong. I’d made peace, figured out what to tell friends and family, all that jazz, and then got the most anticlimactic turn of events ever.

I tried immediately to find somewhere else, but no dice. Everywhere else was closed. I just pulled over to a parking lot outside a gas station, thought to myself, “well, this is so embarrassing and ironic that I have to tell SOMEBODY,” and called a crisis line.

It was honestly the most helpful crisis line convo I’ve had before, not in that it solved my problem of wanting to die, but that the workers on the other end actually listened and seemed to care. Had a genuine conversation instead of being fed canned, painfully scripted responses or hung up on. Cried a bit, drove home, and now I’m typing this out completely unsure of how I feel.

Will I still wanna kill myself tomorrow? Probably. Maybe I’ll still end up going over to a shop once they open in the morning. But for now I’m still stuck here for at least another twelve hours. Do I just… go to bed? Fuck around on my phone? 

Seriously, what is the protocol for this?!

Job searching is making me suicidal,"Hi everybody. I’m 25F, based in the US. I graduated with my B.S. a couple years ago in a life science field. I’m planning on relocating to a major city soon to live with my partner. I know I should be happy, but I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and anxiety solely tied to getting a job. I can’t be happy about any of this because I don’t have a job. 

I have been searching for jobs for a long time, applying to everything I can find, sending in resumes and cover letters. These are low-paying positions, some even volunteer internships, that I am qualified for. I have not heard anything back for anybody; I have gotten rejection after rejection without an offer of interview. I am extremely worried about my career trajectory and my finances, and I’ve had these thoughts of killing myself because I can’t deal with this disappointment in myself and in disappointing others. I constantly wish I could redo my life because I feel like I have wasted my time and potential to do more for my education and career. I have no money to go back to school.

I know it may seem like I’m dramatic for being suicidal over this, but this is so important to me. I feel so useless like I don’t even deserve to live when I compare myself to others who have done something with their lives. My self-worth is tied to a career and I hate that this is my perspective because I don’t think it’s NORMAL to deliberate suicide, from planning the methods to a timeframe, so often because of this.

Everyone is overwhelmingly, insanely better than me at everything I do, it's so frustrating! My art is ugly, my games.... they don't even deserve to be called games as they fail at the very point of video games, which is to BE FUN! How can you call yourself a ""game developer"" when you're incapable of meeting the MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA THAT MAKES A VIDEO GAME A VIDEO GAME?!

And they're everywhere, constantly showing, constantly shining, gaining awards, adoration, or just being insanely awesome, their existence just inherently has more value then mine, they don't know what it's like to struggle, they either never struggled before, or the last time they did was so long ago that they genuinely don't remember what it's like to be terrible at what you do, and how humiliating it feels! Hence why any attempt by them to comfort me feels like the most tone deaf thing ever, they're so out of touch, and so devoid of empathy, they're literal gods among men, yet they act like just ordinary people, try to lecture me about humility when they clearly don't know jack shit about humility! Why can't they just be bad again for ONE FUCKING DAY?! JUST MAKE SOMETHING UGLY OR UNIRONICALLY BAD, GENUINELY, OBJECTIVELY BAD FOR ONE FUCKING DAY, I BEG YOU! PLEASE! DO YOU REALLY NEED TO BE INSANELY GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO EVERY FUCKING DAY?! YOU ALREADY GET TO LIVE IN CONSTANT AWE AT HOW AMAZING AND SUPERIOR TO EVERYONE YOU ARE, CAN YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME FEEL LIKE I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO FOR ONCE?!

Or if not, then at least stop pretending to understand, stop trying to make these tone death ""motivational speeches"" that are extremely out of touch.

I feel like the two big examples of this extremely out of touch behavior is like when artists on youtube make videos lecturing you on humility and the importance of accepting that you're going to suck, and that it's ok to make bad art WHILE PAINTING THE NEXT FUCKING MONA LISA ON THE TIME LAPSE OF THE VIDEO! JUST COMPLETELY TONE DEATH, COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE AND DEVOID OF EMPATHY, JUST SHOWING THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY'RE SAYING, the other big example is the indie game Chicory... which is basically the exact same as the youtube example but in video game format. I hate the kind of people who do these kinds of thing, these assholes who are devoid of empathy and clearly are only doing this to show off how amazing they are while pretending to be humble and pretending to care! I have a deep, deep resentment to them... well... I already resent those who have the privilege of being genuinely good at things as they won't shut the fuck up about it, and let me have an escape from it EVEN WHEN I LOG OFF THE INTERNET! But those who do these kinds of things... there's  a special place in HELL for this kind of insensitive, out of touch, asshole!

I want so badly to have an escape, I'm desperate for it, I'd gladly throw my individuality on the trash if I could be them, but I can't, the only escape is death, but I'm too incompetent to even kill myself. I beg you, PLEASE! PLEASE! SOMEBODY KILL ME! I BEG YOU!

Is suicide ever justifiable?,"TW, obviously. I’ve been thinking about it for a while. And I’m finally nearing my final reasons why. Lost the love of my life because I unconsciously fucked it all up. I’m a workaholic who doesn’t know when to take time off for myself. I can’t stop the nightmares or insomnia when I can sleep even for an hour. I have so many allergies that I could even make it look accidental. I just don’t want anyone who loves me to feel like it’s their fault. I’d leave a timed “send later” text message to my best friend and said soulmate I lost, because they deserve to know. But, my parents don’t need to know that I died on purpose. Is it ever justifiable? Especially if it doesn’t look like it was on purpose? Idk I’m just thinking out loud. This isn’t going to sway me one way or another, just curious and on the fence about everything. I do have 2 mental health disorders and am seeing a therapist who doesn’t help much. My medications have helped for the last 4 years, but not the best recently. ","I think the better question is why are people trying to justify suicide instead of understanding why people are suicidal or committing suicide? Idk this just me || I've asked the same thing and never got a straight answer. From what I've read, a terminal illness is justified and mental and emotional torment is something we're told to continue to live with and never complain about. || In many cases, yes. Battling mental illness sucks and being told to be strong and fed false promises doesn’t make it any better. I don’t believe in someone having to struggle and suffer in silence just to make other people happy. || Shouldn't we have the right to decide what our own destiny is? Suicidal thoughts come from a desperately unhappy and unhealthy place, but not always an unreasonable one. Sometimes going on is simply unbearable. Pretty words of hope don't always fix real problems. I don't know if it's justifiable, but understandable. I think maybe people left behind make the pain of loss about themselves, about what they lost. But what about what the suicidial person's losses and pains. I wish there was more compassion than judgement. || If the person is suffering enough, especially if they’ve been irrevocably damaged.  But it’s up to the individual.  It’s absolutely terrible to be a suicidal person, there’s nothing easy about it (in reference to it being an “easy way out”).   Especially if health is involved and quality of life is compromised then it makes sense why people do it. || If people can justify forcing others into this world, there should certainly be a justification for leaving it willingly || Of course it should be, but not everyone will see it that way. If someone takes their own life, it’s their body and their decision. || Suicide is automatically justified if something/someone drove you to the point of taking ur own life || To me, commiting suicide is a sickness that he/she just could not overcome. I know more people than I'd like to know who have made the decision to commit suicide. All of them suffered in silence, had so much shit going on in their lives that just ate at them every day to the point they thought it was best to do what they did. I don't condone suicide one bit. In fact, I fucking hate it. But I do understand how someone can get to that point. I don't blame them, I just wish I could have seen the signs and been a better friend to them to prevent it. || The truth is that I have come to think that it is, I mean if I were given the choice to live without enjoying life, take pills and be aware that I will never feel what it is like to be a happy and normal person, to die peacefully I would surely demand the second, I would hate to spend my life being constantly tortured that I will never have something normal. || everybody deserves a choice || The world justified Robin Williams decision and never once heard anyone call him a selfish prick. || Something is better than nothing I say || If I'm being honest, I can't say it's not. I'm not just gonna deny someone's bodily autonomy by not letting them do what they want with their own body. So I can't say it's *wrong*
Justifiability is slightly different though. That implies that you need a reason to do it, and is very very subjective, especially when it affects you almost exclusively. So if you have a reason that's good enough for you, then you already have as much justification as you need.
But I challenge you to logically argue against your reasoning, and to find new meaning (or maybe a new girlfriend) || Some people feel done, and I don’t blame them. Life's not worth enduring || It’s not justifiable. 
But it’s understandable. 
And it’s not cowardly. || Some people justifying suicide are suicidal themselves and truly believe that life can be so unbearable the suicide *is* the answer. It always makes me feel so defeated when I stumble upon arguments that kind of don’t acknowledge the many people suffering not-so in silence about being suicidal and having a life, from birth to death, that wasn’t worth living. Especially when we live under capitalism that we simply cannot escape unless we have millions upon millions of dollars? || I accept that a terminal illness is justifiable if you’re in the edge and you ask and legally release someone to “”pull the plug”” so to speak. But having to live with bipolar disorder and take pills that emotionally blunt me for the rest of my life seems like a waste of life || We don't have that right as we do not belong only to ourselves. Whether or not you realize it, you belong partially to a bunch of others. Mostly family, friends and your community and fully to God. || He did have a severe brain disease. That doesn't justify it, but it can help explain being less in control of your actions due to it.",1753721056.0,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mblbl0/is_suicide_ever_justifiable/,SuicideWatch
Please convince me why life is good,"I desperately want someone to just make me understand. So many people never consider suicide, and I feel like they just see something I don’t.

I’m afraid of pain and I’m squeamish, but I’ve only got reasons to kill myself. I’m overworked. I’m poor. I’m lonely. Been neglected and bullied. I’ve been losing for my entire life.

I can’t offer an answer, but are you willing to tell me more of what you’re going through that’s causing you pain? What you’re going through sounds hard, so I’d like to hear, if you’d like to share. || I agree with what the other commenter said. From what people tell me, it starts with the day-to-day little things, like seeing the sunset or having a really tasty cup of coffee that day, even though that may not be enough to make you feel everything is good. And for some, finding gratitude in the mundane makes it easier to find a bigger drive or will eventually. || Take time out each day and listen to music until you numb the pain || It's nice you are showing us your worst, but what about your best? What do you like doing that makes you feel a tiny bit better than usual? || Everyone has a different drive and inner thing that will make life good for themselves. One persons reason to live may be your reason to die. You’ll have to find your motivation/will to live yourself || Thank you for offering but idk what good it’ll do. || > it starts with the day-to-day little things, like seeing the sunset or having a really tasty cup of coffee that day

Sorry if I’m bitching but people always, always say this and I just don’t get it. Enjoying the “little things”.

I can’t promise anything, but I’ll do my best to listen and respond. If not, that’s okay. I’m still here for you :) || Nah I don't think that's bitchy lol I agree.

Feeling lost?,"Hi guys. I’ve been suicidal on and off since I was 12. It feels like a never ending battle. I feel like I’m failing at every single aspect of my life - career, friends, relationships, family, even being a pet parent. My dad passed when I was young and my mom is currently dying of alcoholism. I’m 25 now. I’ve lost contact with my college friends, high school and childhood friends.

My apartment-mates don’t like my cat, but I can’t get rid of her because I love her. After a fight with my primary partner, who I was considering marriage with, I don’t really have anyone besides my grandma who is quickly deteriorating and doesn’t have much time left. Prescription medication can only do so much. At the end of the day, I can’t form any consistent habits to make my life better. I can use PTSD, depression and anxiety as an excuse- but the result is I’m not someone people can rely on, and I certainly can’t rely on myself.

I am not sad that I'm going to die. I'm sad that I wasted my youth. All the years I could've built something good, and ruining a relationship by being afraid to show the world I was in love.

I do have some things in life that bring me some joy, I do very much enjoy handicrafts, particularly leathercrafting, but alas I can't really afford to do all that as I'm completely incapable of having a steady job due to my various issues, and thus my income leaves little for anything pleasurable. I have a reliable and supportive friend group & parents. I think I'm at peace with what I am, I hardly have much to complain about in life besides being broke. I have medication, I've had therapy, I have recurring visits with medical professionals. 

So why exactly do I want to die? For most of my life I've had these thoughts, when times were good or bad, doesn't really make a difference. If I didn't know exactly what having a loved one commit suicide feels like, surely I'd have done it by now. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are people who depend on me, and I have to keep going despite wanting it all to end. If not for myself, for them. I'm not going to kill myself, at least not any time soon. By all metrics I should be happy, but it just doesn't feel possible for me to be happy. I have everything, except money, that people generally seek & value in life, yet it changes nothing. I don't think I can be happy. I don't know why. My life is miserable, when it obviously shouldn't be. I'm so very tired of feeling like this all of the time, but again, it seems that I do have a place in this world. So, to put it shortly, I have little reason to be miserable, but I am. I absolutely want to kill myself and would do so at a whim should it not be at the cost of the people that I care about. So I suffer every day, with a simple goal of making others just a little bit happier. If I can't be happy, I'll be damned if I don't at least help others have what I can't.

I don't necessarily need advice or anything, but discussion is certainly welcome. Your time is valuable, and I appreciate that you've spent it reading my ramblings, it does mean something to me, knowing that my story is out there.

You have to pretend like you can get better when you have a 50/50 chance and maybe even less of feeling better. I don’t want to give anything back to this world or to the people. Why do so many people want themselves to be remembered? Who the hell cares? 

Being human is so disgusting, I hate my body and I hate the natural emotions I feel. I hate my brain. I hate other people, and I hate the natural desire to keep living and to avoid suicide. It’s so repulsive.

But with all honesty, this world is so useless to me. With no point at all, why do people still want others to keep living? I will never feel comfortable in my body and I will never NOT hate myself. I don’t even want to get better, if I had to live i’d rather live in misery.

I could never believe someone hates themselves more than me, because I have never liked one thing about myself. My days are extremely meaningless, I’m about to go to school again  and start the same fucking routine while I have a job to save up money for what? for what?? For a college I will probably fail in??

I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted. 
I want to go, sometimes I lay down and cry and I just feel empty. My kids are in good hands, my wife will cry but after a year, maybe two she'll move on. Nobody else will care.

When I finally found a company that would take a chance on me with no experience, they fired me after less than two months with no warning.

After that, I got duped into taking a job with Accenture that had ""accounting"" in the job title but turned out to have next to nothing to do with accounting. Two and a half years later, I finally found a tiny accounting firm that was willing to pay me $47k a year with no benefits. After I got my CPA license, I got hired by a plastics manufacturer, but they ALSO fired me after less than two months with no warning. Next I went to work for a mortgage lender, which I loved, but they outsourced most of my job to India and then laid me off. Ever since then, my life has been a waking nightmare.

Trump getting elected again sealed the deal. A part of me was still hanging on to hope that we were moving towards a kinder, more tolerant world. Now it's abundantly clear that isn't the case. There's no place left for people like me.

We were originally together for just a few months, before she ghosted me the first time, right after my dad died a few years ago. 

I lost my job right after that too. It was awful. I cried constantly and couldn't sleep and had no appetite.  Then I started exercising, and got really into fitness, and got in the best shape of my life. I was pretty shredded. 

But then I got back together with my ex, we got a place together and we got married in May. Now I regret how much time and energy I wasted trying to get her back and being miserable. It wasn't helpful and it made the few people with whom I interacted miserable too.

I was never going to fill that out and went to the art group without issue. I went to the art group fine and the therapist lady thanked me for attending, but after sitting in my room dissociating and staring at the wall for 6 hours I was calmly but firmly discouraged from attending another group by the nurse assigned to me and the other therapist lady running this group.

Have held out for so long and things only get worse,"I am 24 and while there have been some amazing moments in my life, so much of it has been filled with pain. I am trying my best to make a better life for myself, but I feel like I'm failing. 
I went to college and graduated over a year ago, but I'm still stuck in the service industry working nights and weekends. I went to school for app/web design and the field was horrible, so I tried sales and am still struggling to find anything. I hated high school, hated college and then was stuck studying something that not only has screwed me, but also that I ended up not even enjoying. I had to move out before I was ready and was screamed at for ""needing to grow up"" at 23 because I lived at home for 6 months after graduating. 
I have no relationship and have dated, but haven't had anything serious in 4 years. The only time I feel ok now is when I smoke weed, the days I don't all I can think about is killing myself. Life genuinely has not been worth it for years and its only getting worse. I don't even want to keep going because I'm just tired of struggling.

The next train I hear will be my last,"I live in front of active train tracks and I do mean active. At least three or four trains pass by daily, except on the weekends. And I just can't do this anymore. All my life I've been trying to get out of bad situations, only to find myself in a worse one.

I moved from California to Texas to get away from my POS father. Only to end up homeless. I move from Texas to Michigan to get out of living on the streets. Only to end up in a hoarder's den with one of the worst people I've ever personally met. I moved out to prevent being homeless and getting sick. Turns out, I can't find a job for the life of me and now I can't pay my rent, so I'm at risk of being homeless. Again. Whomp whomp

Bad luck is constantly following me around and I've come to the conclusion I'm the bad luck charm. I can't provide for my family, let alone my cat. I'm constantly having to beg for money because out of the hundreds of applications I've put out, I've only gotten **FOUR** interviews in the two months.

I'm at my breaking point. I feel like a parasitic leech and I'm just... I can't do this anymore. People keep telling me there's hope, but I don't see it. I'm transgender and the world is becoming increasingly hostile towards me. I'm unemployed and can't pay my bills. I'm on the edge of losing an apartment I just got because I'm not good enough to get a call back.

Why should I live past 30 if nobody likes me,"The reason they don't like me isn't because I'm abrasive, or rude. It's not because I'm arrogant. I'm just never not going to be socially awkward. I will never have the kind of personality that causes another human being to perceive me as someone they respect as an equal. I'm not even that bad really. But I'm never going to be liked. I have spent my entire life being a social reject. Trying and failing to remedy it when I could actually muster the courage to get past social anxiety to interact with others, only to attain not higher social position than being the ""joke"" of the group. The guy who has some friends, but those friends all have much better friends. And they'd rather not introduce me because I'm me, and nobody really likes me. 

I'm not a basement dwelling loser. I have a job. I barely got this job or any of the other jobs I have had in the past because no recruiter has every truly liked me. At best I have been given less respect my default in professional settings, and I have to put up with being taken advantage of at times because I'm the unlikable one. And the cruel reality is that if I want a different arrangement, it means I need to try to survive on my own by starting my own businesses or side hustles. Working twice as hard as a regular employee would just to keep a roof over my head and food in my belly. 

And all the while I'll never have friends. But what's worse is that women will never like me either. My personality is too stilted and weird at this point. It always was but if you can't be a natural socially, or make it seem natural, then there will never be any romance or sex to be had in my life, because I will never be desirable to a woman. The only women who ever liked me had those dumb  ideas of who I might be from afar, only eventually to see them fall to the actually existent, emotionally engaging, just electrifying at times charm that other men can  have that I have never been capable of truly embodying. My own ""form"" of ""charisma"" has never been charismatic either. There is no likeable, easy to understand architype of a person I fall into for others to understand me better.

Fighting to survive in a world where I will always be either beaten down or taken advantage of in professional life. Constantly fighting against social anxiety to simply exist, but also to improve my social skills. Still they are stilted and awkward. Still I cannot find the confidence within me to believe that any social interaction I have people brings any value to them at all. And to top it all off, I will never be wanted by the opposite sex. There's a lot of charged accusations to be made against me regarding the final point, but I simply don't think it's worth living a life where absolute nobody of the opposite sex wanted anything to do with you, or they realized there was always someone better around the corner. I'll never enjoy a healthy and fun sex life. I didn't sign up to be born an animal with these feelings and intense desires, yet I am incapable or earning such things through the vestiges of what ""personality"" I have left.  

I don't feel entitled to these things but I don't feel like I should be expected to be happy to wake up in the morning to this grim reality either. I'm probably neurodivergent in ways I'll never bother to get a diagnoses for, because I just don't want to know. It's not denial of reality but if there was a name to put to the condition, it's not like anything can be done about it. I have explored these possibilities and sought out treatments for a variety of different developmental inflictions and no amount of counseling or otherwise has ever ameliorated my pain, or provided any insights I could grasp to try to fix it. 

For so long I tried to incorporate aspects of socially confident and successful people throughout my life and I've never been able to truly embody any of them. 

There is no answer. There is only distractions and the like. I do something like dedicate myself to something like public service and I'd still be laughed out of any of those arenas, or made to hold a low social position among peers. There could be some fulfillment in being like a firefighter or an emt, then what would I be...the nice guy who helps save others, whose social value to others is still nill. 

I just don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to be alive anymore or experience this life anymore. I don't want to see the sun, or the moon, or what tomorrow might bring. I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to go.

I don’t know why I don’t just do it,"Mentions of cutting and sexual abuse/grooming


I’m exhausted. I grew up emotionally neglected. My mom never gave a fuck about me, and my dad was off somewhere doing meth for most of my childhood. I’ve been groomed more times than I can count. Etc.

I have been raised with yelling and arguing rather than listening and discussing. I started cutting myself when I was 9. Each time I was caught, I just hid it better. All my mom did was yell at me, mock me. She’s called me a “devil child”, because I don’t enjoy church nor do I believe in a God. My own mom thinks I’m demonic. It is a fucking headache. I hate my fucking family. 

My grandma is even worse. She doesn’t stop talking on and on about how I should turn to Christ for something to look forward to, like that’s all my life is worth at this point. Well, fuck you too. Go fuck yourself. If you hate me, just say it. The reason I’ve stayed so long is 1) FOMO and 2) the fact that I actually used to look forward so heavily to one day being an aerospace engineer, or an embalmer, or some other passion I have. 

But that’s fucked too, because my grades are plummeting + You can’t do those jobs with the history of mental illness I have. I am covered in scars and cuts. I look mangled. I’ve always been an anxious and skittish kid. I don’t know how else to put it; this is just how I am. If my very existence is what’s wrong, why can’t I end it?

My only comforts, only escapes, are cutting myself, and talking to older men. It’s to a point where I feel like the only love I’ll ever experience is sexual. It’s the truest form of love to me. If I’m not being abused, I don’t feel loved. And it’s disgusting. I know it’s disgusting. I cut their names sometimes, cut little hearts for them. I send them pictures of my body. I flirt and sext. Ive done disgusting things. I’ve licked my blood off the floor, on video, for the smallest smidgen of approval. I love older guys so much. Especially my teachers. I constantly hope they’ll hurt me, just so I can feel praised and loved. I’m fucking disgusting. 

Fuck my life, honestly. I just want to slit my brachial. Nobody fucking gets it. I try to share this shit with my online friend, and he says “well I stopped cutting too and you should stop because it’s bad” “well I turned to religion and it helped” “well that’s kind of gross of those men I hope you stop” etc etc JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP holy shit Jesus fucking H Christ just shut the actual fuck up. 

Nothing fucking helps. I don’t give a fuck about my future. I just don’t fucking care anymore. I hate hate hate being alive. I’m miserable everyday. I dread waking up. I dread working. I dread existing. I just don’t want someone important to find me in a pool of blood. Im scared it’ll suddenly just get better SOMEHOW but I’ll miss it. Oh, and I want to be skinny. I don’t want to be fat when I die. Yet other than that, im sick of trying. I’ve been on three different meds, I’ve tried all the coping skills, it doesn’t fucking work. Ive tried to before, when I was maybe 12, but it inevitably failed, because my blade hadn’t cut any arteries. I always wonder what would be happening right now if I had died. I wish I had died.

It feels like nobody ever wants to be around me. The only time I feel truly praised and loved is when I’m being groomed. But don’t consider this an “application”, I’m already taken. But even he is busy all the time. I’m used to it. I love him. He loves me. I’m sort of also nervous to tell him, if I were to attempt suicide. I’d feel guilty. I don’t want to leave him like that. Yet at the same time, I almost feel apathetic. It’s strange. Can’t stop shaking. I really really want to do it. 

Jesus Christ this has gotten long. I’ll cut it off here. ","I'm sorry. You've been victimized by others your whole life. You shouldn't feel like a disgusting person for falling for the lies of sick, twisted men on the internet when you were a desperate, neglected kid. You deserve justice, instead.

How do other people just feel okay?,"And why does it feel so unattainable for me?

I know everyone has their struggles and they range in severity. I know not to compare, so I won’t.

But how? How do people turn out to be so resilient even when going through the worst things? How do people still succeed and stay positive even when faced with adversity? How?

Some of the sweetest people have gone through some of the worst things and yet they remain positive. It’s beautiful, inspiring. But I’m not like them. I just really wish I was.

While I’m genuinely happy for them, happy to see others succeed and be happy, even more happy to see people pull themselves up from the deepest depths…. I envy them. Those people that are so undeniably good at their core. The ones that stay warm even when left out in a blizzard. They make me feel so pathetic…. I make myself feel so pathetic.

What about me makes healing seem impossible? Why do I constantly think of ending my life even as I actively attempt to make things better so that I can stay? Why do I beat myself up over things done in my childhood that I cannot change? Why can’t I seem to catch my footing? Why does everything hurt? Why do I hate myself so deeply and thoroughly?

Why can’t I cope? In a healthy way. Why do I seek to escape? In alcohol? In fantasies of my death?

What about me makes me so fucking weak?

Just because I’m not cured doesn’t mean I’m not following your advice like wtf. It made me feel 1000x worse and more of a reason to isolate.

"I wish I could talk to someone about my gender, but I can’t because of the suicide stuff.","I wish I could talk to a therapist or some professional about my gender just to finally determine if I’m actually trans or just crazy, but I can’t talk to any therapist honestly about myself because although I don’t have an active plan, suicide is the best, most comforting solution to all the problems I could ever face in life, and that’s not what they want to hear. But even if I could talk to someone without them dragging me away to a psych ward and getting my family involved like it’s grade school detention in the principal’s office, I still don’t want “trans” and “suicidal” to be ANYWHERE close to one another, and I’d much rather add to cis statistics so I don’t actually hurt anyone. I probably am just crazy and don’t deserve that peace anyway.","Honestly, you don’t need an authority figure to tell you what you should be. Do you want to be seen as cis or trans? Nobody can answer that for you.

If the question of if you are trans or not carries this much weight to you, I think we both know the reason. Be whatever you want to be my friend, and don’t let anyone degrade your self esteem ❤️ || Ok, hear me out. What if you decide to transition then realize that doesn’t make you happy either? Is transitioning more about how you view yourself or how others view you? I think these are important considerations. Personally, I would think transitioning would add more chaos to an already chaotic situation. || Well I have no idea what it actually means. What if I’m just a failure of a man? What if I’m just crazy? What if I’m making up all these feelings just because I’m lost in life? I’m just such a disaster and have nobody to talk it out with, professional or otherwise. I guess it’s better for me to die cis anyway. || You aren’t crazy. Your gender is a fundamental part of your human expierence, it’s not something that just lacking direction will make you want to change. What you feel is valid.

If you are unsure that transitioning will be what you think it is, you can always just not do anything irreversible like surgery. 

That way, even if you actually are just making it all up (I don’t think you are ❤️), you can simply forget the whole event and leave knowing a bit more about yourself. || I’m not saying that trans people are crazy, it’s just that I might be a crazy person convincing myself that I am trans, and honestly I might just be better off dying cis than saying I’m trans and hurting the community with all the awful things that I am. || “Crazy person convincing myself I am trans”

My friend, your gender identity is a personal choice. There is no line between actually being it and convincing yourself of it. There is no such thing as an inauthentic trans person, provided you want to be trans for reasons involving your self image and not external factors.

 You feel you are trans, if you truly enjoy life as a woman more and transition you have everything to gain. 

If you end up liking it more as a man, you can walk away and lose nothing

punishing myself by not eating for not having a job.,"i spent the last of my balance yesterday buying presents for my friend's birthday, and i'm unsure if they cared or know how scared i am now. it wasn't until my card was declined for purchasing two bars of chocolate that i knew i'd bled myself dry in just two weeks of moving in.

i recently moved in with them and a few other roommates to alleviate pressure on my mother and to start immersing myself in adulthood, but so far, i've been full of pain and i'm too afraid to express it. the town is small - a college town - and thus has few places to work .. i also cannot drive because the cost of a car is too taxing with my current situation. it seems as if every place i've called requires a driver's license, a degree, is several miles away or isn't hiring until the fall. i can't find a single place that hires without the latter requirements, and once there's a chance and i try to take it, it slips away.

i'm so incredibly embarrassed to be unemployed. i wanted so desperately to succeed when i was younger - but i didn't realise that no matter how hard i tried, it would never matter. i'm going to see how long i can go without eating until i hear back from an employer .. just tea and water. it's all i can afford now.

Hours drastically cut at work. Not making enough money to survive.,"I'm living on PopTarts. I work a shitty fast food job that makes me miserable and now doesn't even give me enough hours to get by. I went from close to 30 hours per week to 4. How is this allowed? 

I work hard. I do everything I can to be helpful to my coworkers, supervisors and customers. I smile, do what I'm told, do things to help without being told, everything I can think of. I spend close to 4 hours per workday just on my commute. I never stop applying to jobs, but can't get anything else. I asked my GM why my hours were cut when the schedule went up on Friday and got no response. I never see her in person. 

I can't keep doing this. If this is just life, I'm not cut out for it. I've been suicidal on and off for years, now, but this is different. I know how I could do it, I know where and when I could do it, and I want to. This is unbearable.

Confused,"7 weeks ago I was happy, I had a great life. My partner of 10 years went to Ibiza and he cheated on me, I was pregnant. I then lost the baby. 

We aren’t together anymore, although we keep in touch. And now I have a health condition that stops me from doing the things I love from being Pregnant. 

I thought I was ok, that I was managing. However I think I’ve been in massive shock and it’s all hit me. I’ve lost the life I thought I was going to have, my partner, my baby and also my own life because I’m stuck in this house alone unable to do the things I used to love.

I wake up every morning and just cry, I feel so empty like I just don’t want to move, helpless that this is my life now and I was about to have it all but ended up losing it.

I’m so scared because I don’t see a future for myself anymore? I can’t stop thinking about suicide, I’m not sure I’d ever be able to do it but it’s something I think about all day, everyday. Like what’s the best way? How would I do it? When would I do it? What if it doesn’t work? 

I don’t know why I’m even posting this but I just don’t know who I am anymore, and I don’t know who I can speak to without worrying them. 

I really want my old life back, my baby and my partner and the life we were going to have. 

Will this pass? Am I just being stupid? Or do I really want to die?

I’m scared of my own thoughts,"Daily I get very strong urges to engage in suicidal behavior. I could be doing anything at all and then suddenly I remember every reason I have to kill myself. I can’t even ignore it because then it just sits in the back of my mind and makes my chest heavy and makes it hard to do anything else at all. Sometimes I scare myself and panic over just the thoughts of my previous suicide attempts/phases, because I know I’m always capable of spiraling downwards again and I’m genuinely dangerous towards myself. 

Other times I just wish I had gotten it over with. It’s gotten to the point where my mind feels like a constant war zone and my day can change at any moment because of how fragile my mind is. It’s like if I choose the wrong series of thoughts then I get stuck into a month long depression or series of actions towards my death. I’m getting horrified by the lack of control I seem to have over my mental health. 

Even when I swore to myself I would do it, it never happened, so that’s a good thing I think, but a couple days ago I was extremely close. I even brought myself out to an empty field and laid a blanket down to die on, but I just didnt pull the trigger. All the fear rushed to me right at the end.

I can’t live with myself after I’ve ruined everything,"Right now, my girlfriend and I are going a horrible situation that may end our relationship and it’s all my fault. We didn’t have the perfect relationship, but I tried my hardest giving all the time, money, and effort I could into our daily lives. We are only in college but I took on extra jobs and helped her with school to make sure we were living well. 

Recently, I’ve learned all of my girlfriend’s deepest issues with my family. For a while I thought everything for the most part was good. However, while she didn’t encourage this, hearing about all of the ways in which my family indirectly hurt my girlfriend made me resentful of them and made me feel like I had to abandon them to be with her because of all the bad things that happened (we live with her family in their house). I used to be close with my family but a lot changed when we grew up and my mom died. I still care about them even if they did a lot of bad stuff that I resent. Last Saturday, we were invited to watch my sister compete in body building but my girlfriend gets emotional trauma from the idea and institution that promotes a certain body type because of her past issues with weight and anorexia. I completely understand her case but I felt like me going would be betraying her. Still I felt horrible because my family always supports me and I felt like I needed to show up for them. 

Then, I did something so stupid and childish that brought on all the horrible things we’re going through. I didn’t tell her I was planning to go to the competition and lied by saying I was going to work, even covering myself by saying that I was doing certain things at work. I was afraid that if I asked to go, we’d get into a massive argument that would destroy our relationship. However, I was wrong. I was caught and I feel guilty. I understand if it seems that I feel guilty for getting caught, but I genuinely feel, see, and understand how terribly I’ve wronged her and nothing can fix it in a quick time. For the past two days, I tried doing my boyfriend duties and taking care of her and getting her food if she needs and helping her with rides to places but she is still angry and hates me and when we’re together she tells me how I was did horrible to her and that she can find a better man and she doesn’t accept my reasonings for doing what I did. All of these I understand but staying here is making me feel empty and suicidal. I fucked up everything and even my family and friends are distant to me. I think it’d be better if I was dead","That sounds really stressful to have to take so many other people's emotions into account. This has clearly taken a toll on your gf, but has she acknowledged that it has taken a toll on you too? The fact that your heart was in the right place and you have such accountability for everything makes me think that it's unfair for her to lash out to the point of making you feel hated, maybe she needs space.",1753771935.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mc4i0j/i_cant_live_with_myself_after_ive_ruined/,SuicideWatch
Suicidal intrusive thoughts?,"Just curious if suicidal intrusive thought are suicidal thoughts? Sometimes I feel like these are like drops adding to a suicidal thought bucket. Although I’m okay rn, it get really bad sometimes, where I just want to disappear. Anyway- anyone else experience this? Or just feeling like ending  after making mistakes or being open? ","I feel like once you open your options up to suicide enough times then it becomes almost like a routine option. Everytime something bad happens to me I deeply consider it and sometimes even spiral in that direction, I’m not sure how to fix this I’m just saying I relate to you, and the more comfortable I got with the idea of doing it, the more often these intrusive thoughts come in. || I definitely have experienced it too! For me, I've had various subtypes of OCD that have manifested as suicidal & harmful intrusive thoughts. When I first experienced them, I had so much shock and fear and guilt around them, but now that I understand it better they feel more mundane. But weirdly, to me it feels like the distinction between suicidal vs. intrusive thoughts is harder to distinguish if I'm unfazed.  Wouldn't a 'normal' healthy person be scared by such thoughts? I really don't know... And I have also have them pop up over seemingly small mistakes or even just perceived mistakes. Wish there was a way to mute them. || I can relate || Yeah, that makes sense. I’ve thought it over a lot, now I guess it’s stuck with me. :/ || I’m sure there’s therapy-related things that can reverse it somewhat or maybe when you catch the small intrusive thoughts, you find some reasons why to love life instead, but idk shit.

I need something to go right.,"My 3 only friendships ended within the last 18 months. 

My relationship ended. 

My parent died.

My job turned to shit. 

My cat is getting old and will probably die soon. 

My apartment property manager is illegally raising my rent and I can't get legal assistance because I can't afford it, but I can't handle it on my own because my mental health is so poor that I can't handle the stress.

Speaking of not being able to afford the illegally raised rent, I also can't afford to move (it's very expensive where I live, and there are very specific landlord/tenant laws that exist to limit how often this happens to people, but landlords and property management companies are banking on the fact that people either don't know their rights, or they can't afford to fight for them), I don't have a savings to assist with moving because the only money that I have available is enough to have my cat euthanized and cremated. I have it because at this point I would target be prepared for him to suddenly take a horrible turn, or at least afford cremation if he passes peacefully in his sleep.

This illegally increased rent thing is recent - like within the last few weeks became a serious concern, and finally after 5 months of emailing my property manager, I heard back last week. That's when it was confirmed that they're illegally raising my rent.

I make the most I've ever made in my life, and I'm still low income.

I am in a position in my life where I've lost everyone, and I've no one to turn to for help - either emotionally, or for assistance moving to make it less expensive to face to do so.

I just need things to stop getting harder.

I just need things to be calm for a while.

I wanna die because I knowingly talked to a guy older than me.,"A few weeks ago I got a message from someone who had an eating disorder and suicide fetish.

"Trauma, homelessness, and now urgent psychiatric care. I need help.","After 3 months of trying to survive one thing after another, I’m now at a point where I need psychiatric hospital care. I’ve been self-harming and recently attempted again. I don’t have the means to pay the upfront fees for admission and evaluation. I need help..financial, emotional, anything to get into a hospital as soon as possible.

I’ll try to keep this short, but a lot has happened in a very short time, and it’s been overwhelming.

Three months ago, I made a post on Reddit (since deleted because of people harassing me or sending sexual messages..) during one of the lowest moments in my life. A kind stranger reached out to me privately to try and talk me down. I told them what I was going through..how my mom had taken out debts with loan sharks and put them in my name. I had less than a week to pay them off. On top of that, my mom and stepdad were kicking me out of the house. I was terrified, alone, and desperate.

After some back-and-forth and them making sure I wasn’t trying to scam anyone, they offered to help. They sent money so I could pay the debt and make a deposit for an apartment. I was able to get a place. I was very thankful. But it didn’t stop there..

The loan sharks didn’t leave me alone. They found out where I lived, harassed me constantly because they think I was going to report them to authorities outside of town. Even after that, they kept showing up, trying to break in. I was living in constant fear.

With that same kind stranger’s help, I escaped and took a bus and ferry across the country to get as far away as I could.

Eventually, I was able to stay with some roommates. But everything I had been through began to catch up with me. I wasn’t stable. I wasn’t safe from the world or from myself. My mental health was spiraling. My roommates tried to be there, but it got too much for them. They said they couldn’t live with me anymore. So I left.

I was homeless for a few days. Then, once again, the same person who had been helping me all this time gave me money to stay in a hotel. That’s where I am now.

But I’m not okay.

I attempted to end my life in the hotel just a few days ago. I don’t want to keep doing this. I don't want to keep relying on that person. It has been too much.. But I also I don’t want to die. I just need help. Real, professional, psychiatric help before something worse happens. I know I need to be admitted to a hospital. I want to go.

But the problem is, most hospitals here require upfront fees for admission, evaluation, and professional assessments even if insurance covers the rest afterward. The cost ranges between $500 to $1500 USD depending on the hospital. It’s money I just don’t have. The person who’s helped me so much has already given a lot and is doing everything they can. They and my former roommates have been calling hospitals nonstop, trying to get me in. But we’re stuck on this: the upfront cost.

So I’m here now, reaching out and asking if anyone can help. Whether it’s financially, emotionally, or even just helping spread the word. I know this all sounds unbelievable. I barely believe I’m still alive writing this. But this is real. This has been my life for the past three months. I’ve survived things I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

I’m keeping things vague here to protect myself and others involved, but if you want to help and need more details before doing so, I or the person helping me can share more privately (depending on what my roommates are okay with too).

Please. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you can help in any way..Thank you..",Thank you so much. Is it okay if i ask you how to make one? i really dont know how..,1753743218.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbv1rp/trauma_homelessness_and_now_urgent_psychiatric/,SuicideWatch
I want to feel safe again,"CW: mass sa of a minor 
(- is for when I tell a different event/go off track)

I had a ptsd attack where I unlocked memories from my childhood. In which I saw multiple people grab and use me in a forest. I don’t know if it’s real, I keep hoping that it ain’t true.

I have a dissociative disorder and hallucinations because I was unattended until I was around 5-6yrs old. I scavenged houses for food and my parents were absent. 

-
I got intoxicated with my best friend and it led to me blacking out or dissociating, I’m unsure anymore. I begged him to strangle and kill me for three hours. I told him details of when my father waterboarded me. I told him that if he ever left me I’d end my life and call the suicide hotline.

He hugged me the whole time and comforted me then left when I fell asleep. He told me he would so he could heal. The day after I had a hallucination episode and picked him up for help. That’s when he told me what happened. 

-
I don’t know what to do. I’ve called so many different therapists to set up appointments and my anti-depressants only have one pill left so I’m only leaning on my anti-psychotics.

I am terrified of going to the mental hospital. I’ve told my parents nothing and I’ve barely told my other mom anything. She is also my best friend’s mom and I don’t want her to talk to him about it after he told me she does. 

I feel suicidal. I have so many outlets and ways to help myself but nothing is working. Nothing is helping. All I want is a hug and for someone to tell me they love me but I can’t put someone through what I’ve put my best friend through again. I can’t handle hurting someone like that. I feel so guilty and I am constantly having hallucinations and ptsd attacks of the situation from when I was young. I feel psychotic even though I know this isn’t psychosis, this is my reality and I’m so tired of it.

Should I go to the ward? Should I text a therapist hotline I have or should I talk to my other mother despite my concerns? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",,1753748509.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbx1wc/i_want_to_feel_safe_again/,SuicideWatch
I’m the problem,"I can’t seem to get out of my own head. Even if I achieve all that I’ve wanted for myself, even if my life appears accomplished, I can’t seem to stop thinking the way I do. And it makes me think that nothing that ever happens to me will ever be enough to pull me out of this hole that I’ve created. I try all the time to pull myself out, and I always do end up pulling myself out, but I’m realising I’m going to live with this brain forever. And my mind rejects life in general. It can’t stand it, it can’t fathom it, it works overtime just to prepare me for living. It hurts. And I’m tired. And I don’t want to be like this forever. I just want out. Nothing would make me happier. I always imagine my death, and my soul finally departing my body, and I imagine that I would look over myself feeling free. I don’t belong on this Earth, I can’t possibly. I have a visceral reaction to just about anything that happens to me. I’ve been experiencing severe panic attacks that knock the wind out of me. Their duration is so short but the experience is so intense, it takes me ages to mentally recover. I don’t understand people’s actions.

Feeling empty,"I’m 23F and dealing with depression rn. I’m lucky to have the life I have yet I still want to go. I see all these stories of people having depression too but having ig a “better” reason to have it than I do? I don’t have friends, I worry my family with my depression talk, I barely have romance experience, I have $9 in my account, my bills are overdue and my power is going to be turned off tomorrow. I spent most of my food stamps and wanted to go to the food bank but it was closed for the day. But I have a good relationship with my family, i have a cat to take care of and I’m in good health. So positives….

All these things stress me out and instead of being a normal human being and do something about it. I just want to lay down and die. 

I feel so empty and down. 

Maybe I shouldn’t even be on here as I dont own a gun, i dont have rope and the zoloft prescription I have would probably just make me throw up and not kill me. How am i even going to kill myself?

I know how much dedication that takes, and even if no one has acknowledged you for that, then this random person on the internet does. 

Second, please don’t rationalize your emotions away but telling yourself you don’t deserve to feel depressed. It’ll cause you to spiral so much further down. Your emotions are real and you have to sit with them and process them, give them room to exist instead of pushing them down.

Third, I followed a path not too dissimilar from yours and found my hope in Jesus. I know many on here would push therapy, and I don’t disagree with that all, but I truly believe the hole in our hearts are there because we are MADE to live in communion with a God who dearly loves us and wants to walk with us.

I am going to punish myself,"My brother (18) died 8 weeks ago. He commited suicide. I spoke to him on the phone 9 hours before. My mother told me about him talking about only living for 2 more days, and I completely brushed it off, because he was talking things like that for years. After that I spoke with my brother on the telephone and he sounded sad, I think he was crying a little bit. I was asking him questions about how he feels, he told me he is feeling like he doesn't want to do anything and that nothing makes him happy. I asked him if he was depressed and he sad no. I than asked him to go to holidays with me, which he refused. I asked if there is anything I could do for him. But besides that I didnt offer any comfort, I didnt feel his pain. It  was like I was for some reason mad at him. I ended the conversation after 11 minutes, because I didnt feel like talking to him. I was distant and cold.
He had an doctors appointment a couple of hours later and I told him to tell the doctor about his feelings (that nothing makes him happy). I wasn't really concerned. For me it was just one of the many problems he had, we talked about them and it was later OK. I had a feeling that he might be depressed, I thought that this is something we still have a lot of time to solve. It didn't accour to me, that he might be suicidal for one second. I couldn't imagine that something like what happend, could happen in a million years. Later in the afternoon I was thinking that I have to call him and ask him how did the doctors appointment go, but when I remembered in the evening, it was already to late.

I feel guilty about not taking him talking about 2 more days, seriously. I feel guilty about thinking that everything will be alright and that it didnt occour to me that he might me suicidal. I feel guility that I was a bitch in the conversation. And I feel guilty about forgetting to call him.

He probably felt lonely his last days, and than even I dissapointed him. I feel like I humilieted him. I cant imagine his pain.

A couple of days ago I decided to punish myself. Simply by living with this  guilt for the next 18 years. I am going to punish myself with rotting with guilt exactly as long as he lived. And on 18th anniversary of his death (29th May 2043) I am going to punish myself with killing myself.","It’s okay suicidal people try to not burden others with their thoughts.

I’m deteriorating again.,"I was doing so well in therapy. I was almost seeing the same therapist for two years, but he moved professions. To say I was devastated was an understatement. 

I’ve spent these past 28 years consistently shat on by all around me: family, past partners, friends, coworkers, and employers. I’m was constantly struggling with the thought, “how could all of these people be so horrible, but I’m not? If I am the common denominator, I must be the problem.” My therapist helped me realize it was that exact way of thinking that sealed me in a self-deprecating cycles of shame, which attracted people who preyed on my vulnerable and people-pleasing behaviors. 

Well, this past May I had my last session with him. Then I married my nearly 2-year long partner so he could stay in the country. Then I got a new therapist who I am not adapting well to. Then my now husband lost his work visa. Now we are struggling financially. Now I can’t afford therapy. Then I realized my only support system outside of therapy, my best friend of many years, was actually not a support system at all. I began identifying her remarks and behaviors and connecting them to how I feel when I’m around her. When I tried speaking to her about it, she turned it all on me and basically said I’m crazy and she “suggests I speak to my therapist.” Then my husband grabbed me by the neck and pinned me against the while during an argument, which was followed by a physical fight. He sees me as some monster. And I’ve recently been flooded with so much anger towards my family for their neglect and abuse. And I cannot speak to anyone about any of this. I am heart broken. 

Just three years ago I was adamant about ending my life. I wasn’t panicked about it. It wasn’t impulsive. It was a decisive choice I had made after struggling with ideation since early childhood. I told myself I would commit when my dog passed away, because he was the only truly good thing I could trust in this world, and no one could ever love him or care for him in the way he needs or deserves like I can, and my greatest act of love was to love for him. However, when I moved back to my hometown o sort of fell into a teaching position at a private school and found purpose. I followed that passion and now have my master’s in education and a beautiful classroom at the same school I once graduated from. And I still love my job, my colleagues, my administration, and most of all, my students. 

I don’t have any desire to end my life anymore, but I do fear the suffering doesn’t truly end, and I was sold a lie. I wasn’t panicked told my suffering as a child meant something, that my mom becoming an addict and subjecting me to horrible abuse made me strong. And that my dad leaving me alone in the house, metaphorically or physically, while he was on his drunken benders or manic episodes would make me more independent than the rest or the rising teens. And my brother’s constant beatings would pay off because I would have a competitive drive that would grant me success and fortune. 

I received none of those things. I’m 28. I’ve already had cancer removed from my body. I gained 100llbs in less than a year. I’m just now making enough money to barely survive. I have no family. No friends. A husband that hates me. And a mind that hates me even more. I feel like I can’t trust anyone. I feel like I can’t trust myself. I have a reservoir of rage bellowing in my gut and I am so angry at the world for how it’s hurt me. How everyone has hurt me. I cannot imagine being able to withstand another 28 years of this pain. Still, every day I am doing my best.

"I Use Suicide Ideation, Can I Stop?","19M and I honestly can’t argue that theres anything significantly wrong with the direction if my life currently, but that’s what makes how I’m feeling make zero sense. Just the normal feelings of purposelessness, meaningless, emptiness, asking why I should even bother, loss of enjoyment, etc. 

Suicide ideation has been a predominant solution to most of my daily occurrences because I don’t “have” to do anything, my state has very loose gun laws and I live right next to a gun store (comedically convenient lol). If I decide I’m truly sick of all the menial, trivial, and tedious tasks that form life, I could literally buy a gun with the ammunition and end it. 

And that’s what helps get me by. I wish I had something more consistent, but I lose hope and hope for a future constantly. I lose faith in myself and my ability easily. Knowing I could splurge the amount I have in my bank account to have maybe like the best week or two of my life before ending it just sounds so blissful, yet sad at the same time. Is there something I can do to change my thinking? 

Obviously I would never wish to think like this or have these thoughts. I wish I were like other normal people who don’t even think about stuff like this and go on without asking “why?”, but I digress.

This shit is hard but I don’t want to perpetuate the pattern,"I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for years. 

From the age of 12 I had to deal with multiple suicide attempts by my mother. I was always told they were just cries for help, including the one time she shot my father in the hand and I had to get them both off to hospital and find care for my sister until they were home. 

When my mother died  when I was 22, I got a call at work from my father simply saying “well she finally did it”. When I asked who did what, he said “your mother killed herself”. I broke down in the corridor at the office crying, which didn’t have a net positive on my career. 

Where I lived, It’s not like on tv. Identifying her body left me in tears and throwing up. There’s no cleanup. You see things as they were. 

I’m nearly 50 now. I’ve lived nearly half a year longer than she did. And I understand her now. The anger is gone. The rage has faded. I understand the despair and the lack of hope or options. 

The only things that have kept me going are my obligations to others and the fact that I don’t want to put anyone through the trauma that I went through. 

I’ve spoken to professionals. I understand their point of view. But I’ve not found anyone I feel hears me. Most people I’ve consulted with either have enough resources to never face my challenges of supporting multiple older family members on shit money, or fall into the “that’s not your problem” approach which breaks the values I was raised with. 

Every day I get up and work 10-12 hours. I have less than 2ft between the bed and the wall so I invariably twist or stub something. After the work shift I sit on a couch until it’s time to go to bed, sleep, then get up and make money for the 3 separate households I’m responsible for.

re: literally what is the point,"i’m sure this post won’t be articulated very well but i wanted to make it anyway. after what i believed to be an insane bout of nihilism that seemingly has encompassed the past decade of my life, i’ve realised it’s quite beyond that. for the past few days i’ve been wondering when my “moment” was going to come, and with that came the challenge of “why do i need to have a ‘moment’ anyway?”, but alas; it’s yet to arrive. and i don’t think it ever will. i feel so disappointed with the way my life has went so far, despite only being here for 18 years, it’s so… lacklustre. i’m flat broke, landing a job is a job in itself, i can’t maintain any friendships. in which, typing out makes it seem so insignificant, but everything just sucks. i’ve tried to word how i feel in my notes out, but it comes out how it always does: petulant and ungrateful. which brings me to the title of this stupid rant. what is the point? i contribute nothing to this world and receive nothing. i feel so unfulfilled, undecided, bored. i’ve tried to kill myself 11 times, albeit my methods were… unsavoury and maybe a little silly. but i think i’ve perfected a plan that will certainly work. but even then the thought of executing it makes me feel the same way i always do; unfulfilled, undecided and bored. it feels like im just walking in circles at times. i can’t even sleep, or stay awake either(?) too tired to keep my eyes closed long enough to actually fall out of consciousness, but i also can’t keep them open to the point that im actually conscious either. it feels like im endlessly floating on a big magic carpet of nothing. i observe the people around me, and it makes me so spiteful, hateful and miserable, because it seems as though it would take nothing to be normal like them and perceive life as a gift. “make the most of it” and whatnot, but it just feels like a curse, and there’s not a waking moment that i don’t wish god or whatever deity that’s up there in that beautiful expanse that would just choose me to go next.","Please stay.

I can’t stand this anymore. It is driving me crazy.,"I’m only here because if I was gone it would break my parents and I’m too much of a pussy to do anything to myself. I should be happy, I have a quarter million net worth, I have a guaranteed career in my family’s businesses doing what I love, I will get a free house once my parents build their retirement home soon, but I hate my life. I hate waking up everyday and having to live another miserable day. I’m an ugly, balding, 21 year old loser. I have literally zero friends, I only have loser hobbies, and I am extremely introverted. The only times I have ever been truly happy in life have been during the two relationships I’ve been in, combined together lasting less than six months. I never dated anyone in high school and my first gf was at 19 from church, but her cult-level religious views and family pressure ultimately didn’t let us have a real relationship and do the things I needed to do which ultimately broke us. My second relationship was with the girl of my dreams who checked every box I have both physically and personality-wise. Good luck finding that again in the middle of nowhere where I live. I finally lost my virginity to her, at least I no longer have that hanging over my head after waiting and failing for almost 10 years, and everything looked to be amazing until she randomly dumped me four months ago, giving me a bunch of BS reasons to pretty much indirectly just say “I never really liked you but my mom pressured me enough to be with you that I just went along with it”. I didn’t just get dumped and blocked, I got straight up lied to for two months by the best actress in the world. Talk about a knife to the heart. My biggest dream in life was to get married and be a dad someday, but that dream will never happen. My parents won’t get the grandkids they talk about wanting all the time (I’m an only child) and I’ll just be completely alone once my parents are gone someday. Dating apps are worthless, I don’t even know why I try, they make me feel worse. Every girl I’ve tried talking to has the conversation skills of a brick wall and make it obvious they don’t want to talk to me. My younger cousin is very conventionally attractive and has a really attractive gf and it pisses me off every time I see them together. Just seeing other happy couples together having what I want so bad pisses me off almost daily. So I’m done. I don’t care about anything anymore. I’m going to lead a lonely, worthless fucking life and I can’t fucking stand it. ","You crave depth, there is so much superficiallityy in the world today. You will find it, keep searching.

I'm considering suicide again I'm terrified,"I'm a trans male, 15 years old. I have been trans for nearly 5 years. Recently I went to my first appointment with a gender related therapist, and I was super excited. It went fine but that's not too important. I was gonna get on minoxidil for facial hair growth, which also made me super excited. I've started it now, 2 days in but like 4 days before starting it i felt mad dysphoric. A huge fear overcame me, what if I'm not trans? That thought scares me, and if it turns out that im not im genuinely considering suicide. I rather die than live as a girl. What if when I see the results from minoxidil I realize that im not trans and hate looking like a guy? It's weird because i already have visible facial hair and am super hairy, people usually think I'm a cis guy, but end up asking me sometimes If im trans due to my voice which is kind of deep but not low enough. Anyway im so confused. I went to a concert and had the singer shout out me ""look at the GUY with cool hair"" (I had liberty spikes that day) and it made me feel so good. That was like 2 weeks or 3 weeks ago. I'm so confused? I dont know what im feeling. I know that im just feeling dread. I feel like I look like a girl, and no matter what I do i can't unsee that. I sound like a girl, I look like a girl, my hair is growing out and that makes me feel sad. But I also find myself questioning if im trans more than I ever used to. What is happening with me I haven't felt like that in years what happened to me im so scared of what I'm gonna do to myself I don't want to feel like this any longer man I want to die instead of dealing with this I wish it was easy to die. Please help me please man I don't want to die but I don't want to consider being a girl im not one bro but why do I feel like I'm not trans? Why do i feel sad that I look like a girl and sound like a girl but then I question my trans-ness??? What is going on with me i need help i need very very serious help because I feel stuck and I want to kill myself I don't want to feel stuck like this man. I feel like I'm in a crisis",">  I rather die than live as a girl.


Ah yes a very cisgender girl thing to say here, hmmm /j


But fr, the doubt spirals are fucking awful. It's internalized societal messaging about who you're ""supposed"" to be - like you were assigned female at birth and therefore must be a girl/woman. Then dysphoria about other things (like feeling like you look femme) can make the doubt worse because, ultimately, the doubt itself and subsequent distress *is* dysphoria. You're panicking and feeling suicidal over the idea of being or being seen as a girl - that's not reasonable doubt, that's dysphoria weaponizing societal messaging to fuck with you.",1753745306.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbvuyw/im_considering_suicide_again_im_terrified/,SuicideWatch

"Medical doctor here, I am suicidal tonight. What’s worse, is that I know how to it. Please someone just encourage me on what’s worth living for.",I j,"I won’t tell you the very stereotypical “things will get better” and “you’ll hurt people”. You shouldn’t live for others, but yourself. 

First off, the fact you’re a medical doctor is incredible. You worked so hard for a position like that that is likely paying off. All the hard work and effort would all be for nothing, and the work itself just shows how dedicated as a person you are. An achievement like that isn’t a small one. Saying that, you are clearly an intelligent person who has so much more to accomplish. 

Something that also personally keeps me going is thinking about the things I haven’t experienced yet. I think about all the good things I never expected to happen. Humans are naturally curious, and you wouldn’t get to experience possible life event’s that you may or may not enjoy. 

How come you’re considering suicide, anyways? Everyone has their own reasons, and knowing the reason makes it easier to work with || I'm a Stage 4 lung cancer thriver of 6-1/2 years because of a doctor. You have probably saved many people and they haven't thanked you. Well, I'm here to thank you for saving them, as well as the others you will likely save. Life for those patients might be different (in a bad way) without your help. You are needed and you need to get to a doctor yourself. || Weed, chochlate, ski, chesse, wine, music, road bikes, Motorcycles, swimming in an lake on an hot summer day and feeling the cold water, feeling the sun on your skin, looking at the ocean, listening to the waves, cookies, the people who you havent met yet, movies, popcorn. || Family, work, everything a lot is messed up.

I can’t even think straight || Pizza is good and you should eat more of it || I’m so sorry you are going through a tough time. Med student here 26 days post attempt, also with MDD. life hasn’t been going as planned for a few years now :/ but that’s life ainnit. Unfair. depression blinds us to any ounce of hope out there and makes us think we’re hopeless and helpless. I believe as a doctor you’ve helped countless of people just as I have as a nurse. And I believe you became a doctor because you wanted to help. 

What if you extended that help to yourself this time? What if you de-roled yourself for this moment and let yourself be the patient fully now? What advice would you give to a patient who is suicidal like you are currently? || you… you are worth living for… I don’t know what is your situation or what is in your head, but you… you are important! For yourself and for others… especially as you are a doctor, people rely on you… but I am guessing the most important person doesn’t yet and that person is you! There is so much beauty around us on a daily basis, there is so much good we can do for us or others, there is so much to experience… stay strong and I am rooting for you to get past these thoughts… explore the world, explore yourself… don’t give up! ❤️ || There are things to live for, even when they aren’t overwhelmingly profound ones. This notion has gotten me off the ledge many times. It’s never been one particular reason, but countless little cumulative ones which make existence worth it || Cinnamon buns or chocolate cake!! || I know your vision may be cloudy at the moment- but the obvious answer should be your work. 

How many people do you help every day?
Every week?
Every year?

Across your lifetime? Thousands.

I know you may be worried about ramifications to getting some help- but do it anyway.

The cost is too high to try to manage this yourself.

Go the ER, and get appropriate treatment.

There is no shame in letting people be aware you’re struggling. 

They’ll help you.

If you need to, go to an ER where nobody knows you.

Works just as well. || M25 here, I’ve been suicidal for most of the past decade. Nothing’s going according to my plans and I’ve failed at almost everything I tried. Been through bullying, cheating and the loss of my father at the age of 16. Depression and anxiety have gotten me to the point I can’t even remember anything from my childhood. Life feels empty and unworthy of trying.  
But there’s still so much beauty and wisdom left to discover in life. There’s still so much places to visit and kindhearted people to meet. At least that’s what I tell myself when I’m at my darkest of moments. Just give it one more chance man. || Hey, critical care nurse here if you wanna talk. I can relate to having the knowledge, which makes it even harder to fight the thoughts. 

Healthcare is so fucking broken, and we see it every day we go to work. There’s only so much we can to and give to our patients. It’s heartbreaking. I know fam practice is a completely different beast than inpatient. I hope you are at least in a decent clinic that doesn’t micromanage the hell out of you. 

What do you do to unwind?

Edit: so much stigma in our line of work too. It’s either dark humor or don’t talk about it at all. I’d be happy to be a safe, anonymous space. || As someone with MDD and drug resistance - I feel you. I work in the medical field, too, and it sucks. 

I'm not going to say it gets better or it gets worse. I don't lie and don't predict the future. It's unpredictable right now. Some days are better than others. That's life. 

I will say that with your skills and capability, you can make someone else's day better. You can live a long life helping others and help lessen the pool of misery they are in. That is worth it. || Please take a leave of absence at your job and spend the time on resting and taking care of yourself physically and emotionally. You are burnt out and depressed and without taking a break it will be hard to ward off the suicidal thoughts. || One time I was in the ER because I slashed down my arms and told the doc stitching me that I fell while doing dishes and I was tipsy from drinking after hosting a dinner party. I had recently been roofied, followed home, and SA'ed by someone that I'll likely never know who it was...so my head was an entire mess. 

Doc knew I was bullshitting. I was in mortuary school at the time and I know most med schools train ya'll to pick up on that shit.

Anyway...while getting my stitches done and getting a tetanus shot, we did goofy sing-alongs of Disney hits. I even opened up about the SA a little bit because someone was brought into the ER for being roofied. She could tell I was upset by what I was overhearing.
That doctor checked on me for at least 3 months. I had planned to try again but I didn't want that doctor to feel guilty for not admitting me to psych that night if she learned I had done myself in. 

You went through med school and even though saving lives is like...ya'lls thing...The impact a random doctor had on my own life was greater than people I've known my whole life. 

You probably have had patients that think of you that way.
And you will have more. || Hey man I hear what you say about textbook responses I had the same thing. However its different when people genuinely give a shit and look at all these responses.

Sending you and anyone else who needs kt the biggest hug || I don’t think there is an “ultimate” reason to live that works for anyone. Some people don’t think about it at all (lucky them), some create it for themselves, some are just struggling as us. I asked my boyfriend and he said that as soon as you give up on the idea that life should be fulfilling, it’s getting better.

I saw your comments about your wife, and I am really sorry about that. I personally think that being alone is better than feeling lonely while someone is next to you. If you can, divorce her. At least one less thing to drag you down.

I think that things that are worth living for are the following: your friends and people who genuinely care about you (getting more difficult to find them with age), hobbies or activities that you love, tasty food, sun rays that hit your skin, interesting book, music that you like. I also actually like repairing stuff and give it a second life. What helps me to carry on through the next day is to disconnect from my thoughts. Gym, surprisingly, clears my head extremely well. I also dumb my inner struggles with gaming(not so good). || If I am doctor,nand overwhelm lot stuff. I will stop everything and fly out counties to 3rd world to be free, rexlax and watch people how happy they are what they don’t have what we have and they healthy and food and cheap.

I'm in the field, and I know how hard you are worked all day, every day. If you need some time to feel better, take it now. Go build a fire and sip a beer. Or hang out with someone or watch a movie. I've been where you are now. I've felt psychologically devastated and tired. What helped me was having a pet to love and just stepping back and thinking""this life is special"". In the whole observable universe, we don't see intelligent life, and I am living a special life where I can enjoy things and think about my own thoughts. It's rare and sick. Doing things you like, or just valuing your mental health more over the outside world could help. The biggest thing that helped me was having a pet to love. || First of all your obviously highly intelligent as you are a doctor not many people can say that but you can definitely do hard things because im sure becoming a doctor wasnt easy and getting out of a depression like you are in is not going to be easy and may take years but you can do it, however for right now here is my advice from a different situation of equil weight. First find a local hike someone small pack a bag for the hike with only the essentials write a note to leave at home saying you went on a hike, go on the hike as soon as you can and let me know how it goes. Dont think about anything i want to know about this hike you dont have to share too much but i want to hear if it was pretty or not, and just any details you want to tell me about.

I’ve tried filling in the void, I seriously cannot compare what I felt with him to any other. I guess I fell in love with the version he could’ve been. I still grieve what could’ve been. I wish he would put in the effort. He was there for me always, as I struggled with suicide ideation and a bunch of bullshit, it’s not casual and it never was. I know I need to let go and I know if I keep holding on it will just keep hurting me, I have always been told I deserve better than him but o don’t think I’ll ever find better so why not settle for the less? Ive sacrificed and changed myself for this man but I guess I expected too much. He treats me well, and respects me and my boundaries so he’s not completely careless since he reassured it too. But I even felt like the only way out was to kill myself in order to get out of this situation. I don’t know what else to do and I don’t want to turn into someone I’m not just to be loved. I suppose this was just another lesson. I wish he made me feel more seen, I feel like I’m asking for too much. We confide in one another a lot and I really did think he was my soulmate.

I'm starting gaming as a way to distract myself and also to pursue more hobbies, I installed Ghost of Tsushima tonight and played for an hour. ",,1753734958.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbrlu3/day_1_giving_life_an_another_chance_not_keeping/,SuicideWatch

thoughts on self-harm?,"hi, this is my first time posting here. i've been quite disappointed in myself lately because i relapsed once again into doing self-harm (cuts on arms and legs) but honestly, i don't think i care anymore- it helps me more than it hurts me. i don't mind the scars either.

so, my question is, as long as there's no suicidal intent and there's a psychological benefit (coping mechanism) why should it be considered as something bad or something that should be avoided?","I cut myself too, and the best advise someone gave me is to never stop trying to be clean. Like if your try and fail let's say twice a month, every month, for a year. Then you see yourself as the person who could only be clean for two weeks and feel like you can't do it, but what you don't see is that out of the 365 days in that year, you've been clean at 341 of them. So just keep in mind that of course it's good to be clean for a long time and all, but you are more then your streaks and your cuts || I also cut myself on the arm very often, and I don’t know how to stop. || As others have said it is truly like fighting an addiction and most addictions are viewed as <<bad>> by society. People for some reason get more sad when there is visible damage on you than invisible. Personally, I have burned, cut and poked myself multiple times and the only reason I am 1 year clean now is because of the scars still being visible and people were commenting on them. It was a way to suppress my pain just like it is for a lot of people. You shouldn't feel disappointed for relapsing. No one can just stop one day without the thoughts coming back automatically. Don't be so hard on yourself and instead focus on the days you push through without self harming. || self harm is dangerously addictive and i still struggle with it at times.

though, it doesn't always have to be cutting, it can be emotional, or physical (in other ways i dont think i want to describe). anything with the intent of harming yourself, is self harm. 

my scars were my cry for help. i dont mind them anymore, though, i do get weird looks from my family or from some others. nothing you can do about it, they're now like battle scars. wear them proud and slowly they will fade. 

i tend to hide my fresh scars very well. if my family knew about them, they would send me to the psych ward again or lecture me ignorantly--perhaps both of them are things i dont want to go through again. 

self harm is like a drug, it helps at first and then it destroys you in the long term. i manage my obsessive and compulsive feelings by self harm. i do feel better after, but hurting yourself willingly isn't great. you dont need a textbook to tell you that. 

i wish i could stop, but i fear the person i'll become if not regulated. what a slippery slope. i do think it's better to not self harm at all. that's the healthy way. but it's hard. || Get a tattoo || I guess my idea of self harm is kind of warped, because I’m a massive masochist and get off on it. I can’t tell when I’m doing it to hurt myself or I’m doing it became it feels good. It’s confusing. || I hate pain i would never || My self-harm is mostly physical pain on the head (hit, slap, punch), so my doctor said it may have long term effect on my brain chemicals or head trauma that will def cost me a more than my regular therapy sessions. || Because it does not help. Do those scars make you more valuable? Regarding self-harm as a coping mechanism is a deception made by depression.


Do you think it won't develop to suicide? The very reason to commit suicide is just like yours. Suicide is just a little bit more active than self harming.


I have been suffering from depression for over 7 years and have been hurting myself, planning suicides. The motivation of planning suicides is that it can relieve everything. Self harming is just an inch away from killing yourself.


Well this comment is not written only to you, but to myself as well tho. || I mean, rub ice and don't cut yourself. || Rub an ice cube over the area you want to cut. The feeling is very similar, they say. || It's not as easy to stop as u think || Thanks, I’ll try this. || You can also freeze ice with red food coloring. So you have also a similar thing to the blood flowing",1753691243.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbao5n/thoughts_on_selfharm/,SuicideWatch
How do I Process my Emotions after Preventing a Friend from Suicide?,"There's a lot I need to do, but at least writing it calms me down.

I just couldn't help it. I ratted out to her sister after she said she was going to kill herself at 12 AM, which she considered as the deadline for her life.

God, it's been a long time since I talked to a suicidal person. I myself used to be suicidal, but I'm healing. I've known more happiness than pain and agony now, so when I was suddenly yanked back in this position, I panicked. I couldn't even get my shit together and provide them company. I gradually freaked out until I panicked when she went silent mid-chat in our conversation. I immediately talked to her sister, and things went silent between the sister and my friend a few minutes later (this was via chatting).

Thankfully, my friend will be sleeping with her sister after the issue was addressed, so someone is watching over her, but I don't know what else to do. I NEED to follow some sort of step or goddamn protocol. It's 12 AM and I can't even calm down.

The first thing I'm going to do tomorrow is to have a conversation with her sister. That's it. But I feel like I could do more... I'm still shaken up...",Breathe. Everything will be just fine.

I don’t know how to stop.  
It makes me feel better about myself... and I hate that, i don’t know how to quit.","the problem with self harm is it releases dopamine and gives your mind something else to worry about other than emotional pain.

How can I fool everyone into thinking I’m okay?,"I’m really struggling mentally. 

I’ve noticed myself viewing people in “black and white” a lot, which is a result of my emotional dysregulation. This causes anger and me viewing people as “bad”, which also makes me want to cut them off. However, I know isolating myself is bad. But I’m worried one day I’ll end up doing it. 

I’ve also noticed myself having “active suicidal” episodes as I call them. They usually happen at night when I’m alone and staring up at my ceiling, waiting for myself to fall asleep. The thoughts and feelings become suffocating. 

I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I’ve tried to talk to my parents about my mental health, but they don’t listen. I have a therapist, but she doesn’t know how bad it is and I refuse to tell her because there’s no way I’m going to the hospital. The only person I have is my boyfriend. But he’s going through a tough time right now and I’m not going to burden him with worrying about me. 

So how can I fool everyone into thinking that I’m doing okay? I just don’t want to be a burden to anyone. But I also feel like I can’t speak to anyone about what I’m experiencing.

suicidal because of my nose,"This is the first time i post on a forum but i hope i will feel better if i let this out. When i was young i had an accident where i fell with my head on the ground and broke my nose. This lead to disformed unnatural nose with a huge droopy bulbous tip. It also has a hump and its overall huge. I ve been bullied because of this during school by boys and girls with the most humiliating unhuman ways. The people that i consider friends also mocked me, even my own father once told me ''how did your nose grow up this way'' and it hurts since today. During this period as a teenager i tried to use all this pain as fuel to succeed in school, so i could prove both to myself and others that i am more than just a deformed characteristic. And it worked, i got into the best university in my country and was succesfull. That time my nose didnt bother me so much because I believed (pushed myself to believe) that I can be happy in life only with what I accomplish. Today, six years after school, nothing has changed. I cant look myself in the mirror without getting depressed or even panick attacks, and whenever someone takes a photo of me I feel like i want to die. As a 24 year old male I have urges to talk to women (I wish i didnt) but thats just impossible when I cant even see myself in the mirror , and remembering when I was younger how girls mocked me and laughed at my face because of this. The last months have been the worst , depression kicked in hard and my nose has become an obsession, I think of it every minute , I dont want to leave my room and be around other people with this deformed thing in the middle of my face. I opened up to my mother today beacause she understood I am depressed for the past few months and I made her cry after explaining to her how I hate my life and myself and how people have treated me since i was a teenager. I will never forgive myself for making her cry, but i tried to keep this to myself and she wouldnt let me. So, i ve come to the sad but true conclusion that the only thing that matters in life is looks, I can win the nobel prize and still people will identify me for my hidious deformed nose. I think everyday of getting a nosejob but I am ashamed of what people will say, not the ones that bullied me but the ones that actually liked me as a friend. I hope one day I get the surgery and be able to look myself in the mirror and stop feeling like a decease. But even if I do im concerned that no woman would like to engage in a relationship with a man that has lived his life since he was 25+ like this. I just hope I never fell and broke it. For the last year what i once used as a fuel to succeed in life has become an obsession that doesnt let me concentrate in anything and keeps me depressed, because i cant fool myself anymore into believing that i can be happy in life just by studing hard and getting good grades, I have social and romantic needs, which i wish i didnt have but i do as a human being.Overall, im tired of this fucked up world and all this people that hurted me so bad so i prefer staying in my room forever and not interacting with anyone.Sometimes i get suicidal and the main reason i wouldnt do it is beacause i dont want my family to be in such pain, i would never be so selfish.For all the people out there that feel this way and have experienced the same pain I have, i want you to know I feel you and I truly wish you the best.",Please do not do this. You deserve love and happiness. Trust me looks are not nearly ad important ad you think. What's under the surface is the key. The younger generation these days seeknmore authenticity. It doesn't matter how you look in fact it could be an interesting feature. So many girls are drawn to character eay more than looks. Maybe thats most girls. Sending you a hug. You will be okay. Dont go. You are beautiful as you are and if you sont think that beauty will be recognised. It will be. I recognise it || thank you for your kind words really apreciate it but tbh i cant give character to i deformed characteristic that doesnt even look like a nose.,1753747107.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbwj8p/suicidal_because_of_my_nose/,SuicideWatch

I begged him to love me again I was so immature . I used to stalk his new gfs account shes totally different than me she looks confident and she loves herself so much. Till this day I wake up every day and stalk her account they broke up multiple times but he always took her back . Well to be fair, I'm over him I don't want him anymore it's like I have ocd.

I realized I kinda behave like someone who plans to die. I don’t have healthy views towards anything.

My best advice is too look forward to that future where you can be have a gf/fwb. You'll get there for sure. We'll make it || Bro I'm a 36 yr old male virgin. And I used to feel the same but honestly I really don't give a fuck now. It is what it is.

Its not even the sex I really want, its the connection and intimacy I want most. And maybe thats my problem, maybe I should just be being trying to fuck anyone I can. From the perspective of outside looking in, thats what everyone else seems to do. It just never made sense to me, like at that point I'll just get a prostitute; its the same thing in my eyes but it'll save time and money.

I got my own place and make plenty of money, I do things that I want without being bothered. For the record, most of my friends are in relationships and it always seems to be shitty most of the time for them. Just constant fighting most of the time.

So take that as you will. What you and I probably ACTUALLY want is a fairytale. And thats probably why everyone just seems to fuck as their main goal and/or get into hollow meaningless ""relationships"".

So my advice to you is that women aren't special. Focus on yourself and do something fun. If you really don't care about dying maybe try being an adrenaline junkie at least that way you'll do cool stuff and have fun instead of wallowing in a miserable state of mind. Just don't be a dick and put other peoples lives in danger. Try skydiving, go hunting, get into track racing, join the military etc.

And I'm willing to bet you have negative intrusive thoughts like me, and thats the main reason you can't seem to get over this. The key to dealing with that is to put your phone and do something else. Literally don anything else except be on the internet. I'd recommend going for a walk of exercising. And start using that anger and frustration to drive yourself. Be angry at how you feel about youself. And use that to change yourself.

It is what it is. Just keep moving. || Hm I can't imagine caring that I'm virgin it’s interesting its just sex",1753638119.0,209,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1masiwj/killing_myself_tonight_because_im_a_vrgin/,SuicideWatch

My mom had a dream and I think i'm killing myself,"Accidentally posted this on my main account. Using my throwaway to repost.

I've been going through a really tough time lately. I'm moving across the country by myself. No friends, no family. I feel fear. I feel overwhelmed. And I feel like i'm approaching the end of my life quickly. I've been trying to live out my last few weeks in a meaningful way, being hopeful of my future and that everything will be okay.

Yesterday, my mom told me she had a dream that we were on the east coast of the USA at a festival with her mother and sister. We all split up and had a meeting point for afterwards, but I never showed. She called my phone and someone who sounded like me answered but she knew it wasnt me. She heard me in the background. She begged and pleaded to talk to me, then a man came on the phone and hung up. She called the cops and they said they dont respond to calls like this because i'm an adult. She called my dad, hysterical. Crying. My dad couldnt hear her due to the background noise where we were. My dad heard her crying and knew something was wrong. ""Our daughter is missing and no one is trying to help."" She checked life360 to see that my location had been turned off 8 minutes ago. She looked at her call logs and saw my number had been grayed out, like it never existed.

Like I could never exist. I could go missing. I'm a selfish asshole because I know I don't want to be alive anymore, and I keep painting my face as if i'm alright, but I think my mom knows. She sees that my eyes have glazed over and I don't listen anymore. I don't enjoy things anymore. I just stay in my room. And sleep. And doom scroll. And smoke cigarettes. And drink. And that's all I amount to these days. Yet, i'm still remaining positive in the public eye. I'm still praying that things will work out for me.

I'm still going to move out of state. And once i'm gone, i'm buying a gun and doing the job that I've never been able to do before.",,1753736641.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1mbsca2/my_mom_had_a_dream_and_i_think_im_killing_myself/,SuicideWatch
No of course I don’t have a “plan”,"I am not doing well. I will spare you the details. Despite my efforts my ptsd during this month made me unable to pay rent. I’ve needed to be on disability but I struggle with basic shit and I’ve never had help to apply. Anyway my family is garbage. Horrible things have happened and I have no money for rent on the 1st. I was homeless last year which is an entirely different story but I built myself up from nothing then a wave of the ptsd and I’m back at square one. 

I’m currently doordashing my ass off but shit keeps happening. Medicaid dropped me on the 1st because I made too much money even though I had to abruptly quit my decent payi my job for mental health and physical health concerns beyond my control. 

I’ve always felt like a burden. I don’t have any friends at all. I only talk to doctors and therapists. I’ve toyed with the idea of ending it. Especially when I was homlesss the only thing that kept me alive was I didn’t want my mom to be sad.

I feel unnecessary. I feel genuinely like a burden to society. My family never loved me. Like I said just bad stuff without deeply trauma dumping on you. 

I was going to pack my apartment & move it into my car again & just leave. Idk I’ve told my therapists I don’t want to play the game anymore. I want to log off, clock out, I don’t want to exist anymore. Life isn’t for me. Like I genuinely do not want to be here.

That being said if I can’t figure out rent by the 1st.

Why does the day after the suicide attempt feel so strange?,"After a failed attempt, everything feels so uncomfortable with myself, it's like oh okay, well I'll go do my responsibilities, everything is so empty and strange.

I guess I didn't get any time to process what happened || Suicide attempts are traumatic in themselves. The fact that your brain went there is a shock to your system. || I'd imagine an attempt feels like it would be a pretty big event. Of course, most attempters don't want anyone knowing what they did, so they act like nothing happened. That's a pretty big dichotomy.

I remember hearing the guy who played the band manager in This Is Spinaltap on the radio. He talked about an attempt where he ate benzos and drank wine on the couch until he fell asleep, not knowing if he would wake up in the morning.

Often times people take medicines that will only cause you great pain and are rarely fatal. Pls reconsider. Who will find you? Imagine the pain it will cause them. I'm sure, and I hope, they don't deserve that trauma. Give yourself more time. Therapy. One day at a time. Listen to music you like, watch funny easy shows. Avoid the news or drama. Try to enjoy a day just doing something you enjoy, whatever that may be. Just try. One day. Set one simple goal (I say this hypocritically, I'm in a similar situation). Give yourself one little win for the day. Talk to a therapist or hotline if you never did. Sometimes getting it out can be the fuel for another day. Everyone in this subreddit is in the same boat more or less. Best we can do is try to encourage each other to fight another day. Order your favorite food, anything.

My advice? Don't focus on that right now. Focus on keeping yourself safe and getting the help you need. You are going to be coddled. It's inevitable. But it's just coming out of a place of concern and care. They don't realize they are doing harm. If it means a lot to you, speak to them about it. Ask to be treated as normal.

Had to end this pain,"I want the guarantee and safe way to die. Dont want to get rescued and end up in paralysed or anything.

I can't see anything worth living for,I shouldn't be this tired with life but I am.  No one cares. So what's the point ,"When you are deep down in the hole, the things that you desire or the things that actually give some happiness can appear. Maybe it's not what you can have, it's what you already have and you take for granted, maybe it's other perspective that can make u feel Thankful for your life or the things you have.

And obviously it doesn't work like that for everyone, it could also be not due to a certain type of thinking, it could be a chemical/hormonal imbalance in your brain, which you could treat with a psychiatrist. 

In my case it's both, I'm not speaking from the perspective of someone who is happy, in fact I deal daily with the feeling that I feel brutally discouraged, sad, with a pain and anger that burns Every bone in my body. But one thing that's helped me is being or trying to be grateful for what I have. As cliché and Disney-like as it sounds, it's really helped me (that and the pills, lol).

I tend to think a lot about my difficult past and try to pat myself on the shoulder saying that everything got better In the end. A year ago I lost my arm. My mother tried to kill herself. I took her to the hospital with one arm. I also ended up with a broke af from gambling and the cost of the hospital, leaving me with my mother and no money to pay and Without being able to tell anyone because my brothers are younger and they shouldn't have to carry that weight, and my girlfriend had broken up with me... everything was a mess. 
And I'm not saying that I'm not a mess now or that I have a wonderful life, but I got out of that hole, now my life has stabilized a bit and I'm grateful for every day. I try to be strong, as strong as I can be To help those who need help.

Time will give you some answers and I hope you feel better.

Someone help please,"I want to die again, it never stops it always comes back. 

The worst part about life is when you put so much effort into something and it yields no results, ending up with wasted time and energy.

"I only have 16 days to kill myself, and it is pushing me to extremes.","I have 16 days left or my landlords will kick me out, I should plan faster, I tried hanging myself in a forest, two times, wasn't successful.

Now I'm trying to source a supposedly lethal substance, but I'm afraid that will take even more time even if I manage to finally get it.

This has got me thinking about more extreme methods. I never wanted to inflict pain and trauma to other people especially not strangers, a train driver doesn't have to live with the guilt that they killed me when I inevitably jump in front of them, and other people don't deserve to see my head plastered on concrete after I fall from a height.

There's also a bit of fear involved, since these are brutal methods. But I can afford to overcome that.

I don’t understand why people think it’s cool to hurt others,R,"After one point that's what I started to expect from people, doesn't surprise me anymore || Because people are pathetic and sad and need to feel powerful.

Dogs are good. || People also believe that those that hurt people should be able to get away with it and that feeling angry about it is wrong on YOUR part. || That’s only some people - especially sadists or sadistic types.

I need advice badly,"I’m 28 years old, and I feel like my life is basically over and I should just end it before I suffer more in the future. I’m just so sick and tired of waking up everyday knowing I’m a failure. I’ve been disowned by my family for awhile now, I really didn’t want it and I still miss my family dearly but I wasn’t given a choice. I had many opportunities in life that could’ve caused me to be at least somewhat successful enough I could survive on my own but none of those opportunities ever came to fruition. I’ve reached out to friends to ask for help and advice and all I get are the same answers of I got not clue figure it out. 

To start my life was simple but strict at the same time. I was forced by my family to get good grades and to potentially make a better life for myself. I ended up learning later in life that it was all a lie. My straight A’s in high school didn’t mean shit to my family and instead of helping me go to college or university like I wanted to they spent it on themselves and their Mexico trips. Arguing that I should’ve already figured it out by now. I feel like I was robbed at my chance at a decent life. My father then forced me down into the trades and it was the worst decision I’ve ever agreed to in my life. The trades plumbing and HVAC not only ruined my mental health severely but physically as well. I’ve nearly lost my life several times working on site or just bad luck in general with the trades. I was treated like dogshit for 11 years straight with no change. I’ve been a plumber for about 11 years but I recently lost everything that meant anything to me. Not only did I lose my job but I became homeless. Lost my car, lost my house, lost my wife, lost my dog literally anything and everything that belonged to me. This phone is all I have left at this point. I’ve searched for a job for 9 months so far but I haven’t gotten any luck so far. I’m really struggling badly to give myself reasons to stay alive and a purpose for living. 

I have called the suicide hotline almost every single day, and they also don’t know how to help or how to give me advice or anything so I can at least be given a chance to have a normal life. So please anyone and I mean anyone, with proper actual useful advice please let me know… ","I’m not going to lie, how I would do it is very simple. I don’t want anyone seeing me when I die, nobody deserves to see the empty husk of a useless man on the side of the road.

Rather content with this fate.,"Though I am so very afraid to die, I really have no means to stay. No matter how hard I try to be good for people, to stop being what a horrible human being I am, I fail miserably. I'm too self-indulgent, too disconnected, too insecure. Nothing I do can fix it anymore. They've made it painfully obvious how little representation I am capable of. It's always ""You have no empathy"" or ""You're too literal."" I'm sorry, I don't quite understand how to not be the way I am. Words mean what they mean, I can't really grasp the underlying concepts, I just say I do.

I just wanted to make them smile, laugh a little. They never had good lives, none of them. I just thought maybe sticking around would have made it a bit more tolerable, and at best enjoyable. I just can't. I've tried everything to please everyone, being quiet, being obedient, being social but I just can't stick to it. I'm too selfish to do as they need, and it's quite painful.

These past few nights I've lurked on this subreddit, taking my shot at helping those in the same boat as me, but even so I doubt those words left much impact. Too blunt, too sporadic, too inconsistent. That's what I am, that's what I've always been - That's who I'll always be. I can't change, I never could of. I'm sorry for being so scared for so long, it was rather inconsiderate of me I must say. I'll never be human.

I only hope I can neglect the instinct to thrive & survive and gracefully accept what is and what will come in the foreseeable future; simply being this.","Reading this post I honestly believe you are a good person. Going out of your way to reach out and try and help others is not a convenient thing to do. Yet you're empathetic enough to try. Intentions truly do matter. Let the instinct to survive carry you through the hardest days. When you've hit the bottom the only way to go is up. One step, one day at a time.
