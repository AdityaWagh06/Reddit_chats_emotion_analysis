"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2366,1572360722.0,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",46,1744611968.0,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/
I am stuck in what is by far the worst depression I've ever experienced in my entire life,This is beyond anything I was prepared to handle. I'm already on two antidepressants and they are not helping at all. I'm slowly but surely losing everybody and everything. I have suicidal thoughts nearly all day everyday. All I have to look forward to is opioids tomorrow then it's back to hell. My soul cannot take this any longer. I can't get any help because I don't have any money or insurance. I don't have a working car anymore. I've lost everything because I can't function. I haven't showered or washed my clothes in weeks. I'm only eating once every day or two. My own mother is hardly even speaking to me anymore as well as all my friends except my ride or die and even she's having a hard time handling it which I understand. I can barely put into words how absolutely God awful this is. I just want it to stop. I am in so much pain. Please tell me I'm not alone.,184,1753739569.0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbtl1a/i_am_stuck_in_what_is_by_far_the_worst_depression/

My life was over before it ever even began. (rant),"I'm a 33 year old man. I wasted my entire young life wallowing in self-loathing, and indulging in destructive habits, mental, emotional, and physical. I've never been athletic and I was never taught anything about nutrition. I was smart when I was young, but lazy, and a chronic procrastinator. Needless to say my mind and my body have just about wasted away.

About a year ago I made the decision to join the Army. I had nothing going for me anyways. I hated the menial, servile jobs I was working. The military was a huge opportunity for somebody like me. Not only would I be getting payed to be trained in a field that is actually my dream job, I would have a chance to change my mind, and my body around.

I've been putting in a ton of effort. I gave up drinking alcohol, I gave up caffeine to help fix my sleep, I completely overhauled my diet to the point of being obsessive, and I've been exercising harder than I've ever exercised in my life... or so I thought. For all my effort, I haven't seen any much improvement if at all. I don't feel stronger at the gym, running never gets any easier, and I don't look any better. But I acknowledge that it's my fault. I guess I'm actually not trying as hard as it feels like. I'm weak as hell, and although I sweat a lot and strain my muscles, I always leave the gym feeling like I could have and should have done more. People say that exercise is great for depression, but I often leave feeling down, and angry at myself for being so inferior. I'm probably in the best shape I've ever been in my life and it's so pathetic to say that my best is still worse than the base line.

I feel like I only just started truly trying, and yet it feels like it's already too late. I feel old. My body hurts. I have knee and lower back pain. I'm ugly, I hate my body, I have no confidence. I'm surrounded by young, athletic guys in their prime. They're smarter that me, have more going for them than me. I don't fit in with anybody. I feel like I don't get other people and other people don't get me. I don't have any friends here or back at home. I feel lonely, sad and angry all the time, and I don't have anybody to talk to. I feel like a rat trapped in a cage and I don't see anything ever improving.",31,1753759618.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc0wou/my_life_was_over_before_it_ever_even_began_rant/
Contemplating about Suicide that I was very sure to commit,"For the past two months, I’ve been thinking about ending my life more than ever before. I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, and although I’ve had a few serious attempts in the past, this time feels different.

This time, I’m not acting impulsively. I’ve made a plan. I’ve picked a date. And with each passing day, it feels more like something I’m meant to do. I’ve even researched famous suicides looking for inspiration, trying to make sure nothing can go wrong.

I’m currently in therapy and on antidepressants, even on the maximum dose, but nothing seems to change. Today I told my therapist everything: the method, the plan, and why I feel so certain this time. He asked how he could help, and I told him nothing could this is a final decision, and nothing in this world could change it. I was completely sure until I got home.

Now, I’m torn again. Part of me still believes that my problems are too deep and permanent to ever be solved at least not within my lifetime. I don’t just hate myself. I feel like I was never meant to exist among other people. Like I’m something else entirely. That I don’t belong here, that I never will.

Even if I kept going, nothing would really change. I’ll always feel this way. Suicide doesn’t feel like a choice it feels like my destiny. But then something my therapist said made me pause. It made me feel guilty. I don’t know how to go from here. What would you do?

I don’t know. I can’t elaborate better than this I would like to do but I’m just tired.

Immediately depressed about being single after talking to co-workers who are in stable relationships.,"I had about a whole hour of neutral stable emotions this morning..maybe even could say I was happy. And then I showed up to work, bumped into a friend and he starts talking about his relationship and trying to get married. And that was fine for about a whole minute, then when another co-worker comes by they both start talking about their relationships and im just standing there like an idiot with nothing to say because im single, with no dates, no recent relationships, and no self esteem to pursue dating. I had one failed 5.5 year relationship that ended 3 years ago and almost nothing since then. I've had a couple short lived relationships that I got dumped by each time. And it just hit me this morning about the likelihood my 5 year relationship was the best chance of having a life long partner and it wasn't even the best relationship. Im over 30, I have no ""game"", I have no money, no friends, no quality job outlook. Today just really feels like one of those days where im just thinking about how much longer am I supposed to do this before checking out?

I just want someone to listen but I can't speak.,"In real life, I can't talk to anyone, I don't put any effort into maintaining or creating any sort of relationship / friendship because I just don't want to talk. But I am so desperate to be heard by someone.

Diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression and recently borderline personality disorder.

I have a three year old child, full time single parent. Currently studying online. Live alone in a rented property with my child. They are the only reason I don't end it all right now.

I have no family. Well I have parents and a brother but they are unwell and it is hard to see them as we live far apart. 

Child's father is not involved in her life. DV.

I thought I would have been so much more by now. Happily married, nice house, following my dreams, being successful.... and the reality is I am crying while writing at my computer to strangers, hoping someone somewhere has a nugget of wisdom that will keep me going. If I didn't have my child I promise I would end it all, but I can't leave her, she would end up in someone elses care and no one would love her like I do or give her everything as I so desperately try to.

I am so alone. I have been single for three years. When I was young I always had boyfriends etc. Which when digging deeper, was probably due to childhood trauma.

I am so aware of time, life feels surreal and I'm desperate for game over. ",7,1753783549.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc7gom/i_just_want_someone_to_listen_but_i_cant_speak/
Ruined my life.,"Ive only been truly in love with one person since I was 15, I’m 25 now. The only meaning and purpose ive made in life was to love this girl. She was the only person I would’ve married and had a family with.

It’s been over three months since we broke up and I know deeply that I will never love someone again because I’ve never been able to. I try but no one is ever her. 

Prior to this year I had to end a six year relationship because all I ever did was dream about this girl even after not talking to her for six years. 

My life now is dreaming about what could’ve been, her having children with the new guy etc. it’s very rare I don’t wake up from dreaming about her. No matter what I accomplish or do I think about her every morning and night. Nothing matters anymore I just do good things hoping one day something will work out but I know deep down there is no plan B and I’ll be haunted by this relationship for the rest of my life. 

Ultimately she probably did love me and I ruined the best thing that will ever happen to me. I won the lottery and blew it. I’d trade all the money in the world to just to live in a tent with her. 

I have nothing meaningful and never will. ",4,1753791759.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc9ynf/ruined_my_life/
I don't feel human anymore.,"I want to be completely honest with my emotions here because after reading other people's posts, I feel like this is the only place where I can talk my emotions without being judged and told what's wrong with me. I'm not sure what depression anxiety is and whether I have it or not, but I had a really traumatic background in which I was bullied by the majority of the people in my life. I'm now a 26-year-old boy who recently graduated and works a 9-to-5 job. I don't have any friends so far, and I've never really engaged in a meaningful conversation with a girl. It's not that new people, like those in college or my colleagues, are unwilling to talk to me,  rather, I tend to keep my distance from everyone because Whenever I try to converse with others, my heart races rapidly, my face flushes, and my mind goes completely blank even to the childrens except of my mom. I’m not sure why this happens every time. Last year, there was a moment when I finally resolved to put an end to my suffering; I bought a rat poison, locked myself in my room, and wrote a few words to my mom. However, once again, I found myself too cowardly to go through with it. I feel so ashamed of myself, my existence, and how much of a coward I am. This shame keeps me awake at night, and I constantly regret allowing others to bully me, thinking I should have chosen to stand up for myself . It's an awful feeling when your soul does'nt respect you . Honeslty  living like that is incredibly difficult. I'm unsure if I'll ever come to respect myself or feel proud of who I am. However, I deeply desire to experience that feeling someday, even though I have no idea what steps I need to take to attain it. Achieving this is the only goal I wish to fulfill in my life.",11,1753775816.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc5hl2/i_dont_feel_human_anymore/

"What's the point of trying anything, if nothing ever works out, no matter how much effort it took?","M, 24. I got rejected by another woman just yesterday. I don't know how many times I was rejected up until now, but there were lots of them. I never had a girlfriend. I've never been told by anyone that I'm loved and wanted(my family doesn't count, because the relationship between me and my family was never exactly perfect). Just like I was never able to find a well-paid job. I started investing several months ago, but I only lost money so far. I can't even learn stuff because I get easily overwhelmed. I'm forced to eat several different kinds of pills every day, because I was born with several incurable illnesses. I always start spiraling so hard when I fuck something up that I want to kill everyone in sight and then off myself as well. Nothing ever goes according to my plan and I'm sick of it.

Hate my life so bad,"My wish most nights when I go to sleep is to never wake up again. Life has no meaning to me. The only thing I found two years ago that made me feel anything was gambling. But it took more from me than I expected especially in terms of debt and the money I lost, which I could have used to help my mom, who needs it.

My only fear is that I don’t want my death to be a burden to my sister or family. If not for that, I would have ended it already. Honestly, I might once I have my life insurance setup, so no one has to spend money on my death.

I’ve tried to find meaning in life, but nothing makes sense. I believe in God, but I don’t understand why He would put us on this earth. What’s the reason? To see people die, hate each other or live? It makes no sense to me. Still, I know there is a higher power.

Lately, I’ve come to the conclusion that if life is a test, I don’t want to take it or be part of it. Every morning I have to wake up and put on a fake face, even though I know there’s a vacuum inside. My gambling addiction isn’t helping either. And honestly, I don’t think anyone can help me, other than ending it all.

I’ve been in therapy for about a year and a half, but it only seems to help for a few hours at a time.

I've been so depressed that now I cant even share anything with anyone.,"I've been depressed for the past 5 years and even more so the last three years. This past year I've spent most of my time couped up in my room, procrastinating on everything. Pure nihilism and suicidal ideations. I only go out once or twice a week with one old friend who reaches out. Even then I just pretend. 

Because of this depression I got into religion more to understand things better, with it lots of theology videos and philosophy. Anything to just get me to a new place of thinking.

What happened in turn, (even though I was a lefty) I became agnostic atheist. Now I am even in deeper meaningless-ness. And I can't share this with my family because in thier minds it doesn't need to be that deep. So I just pretend now, it truly is a new kind of aloneness. I am lonely too time to time but it doesnt bother me. 

Im very close to ending it all but what stops me is the pain it will cause my family. But truly if I can't even push myself to do basic things and not be afraid, overwhelmed and flustered what's the point? I could somehow in the past push through it all. But now the responsibility to just live and exist feels too much. 

To get up to shower, to brush my teeth. I did all this in the past because I had to, because external factors like school and work made me do them. But I still felt optimistic about life then. 

Now I wake up and I wish why I hadn't died in my sleep.

"was doing better, now it hits me like a bus","I'm (22F) thinking about to end myself since the 6th grade. Went through some traumatic shit in the past. It's crazy to me, that I'm still alive.

Then, 2 years ago, I thought I found the love of my live. The suicidal thoughts almost vanished for the most of the time. It felt SO good, you can't imagine. Life was FUN. To be mentally well is such a privilege.

For context: Caused by my traumatic past, I became very codependent and I'm very anxious of being abandondent and left alone.

I wish I was never born,"I've tried. But I am tired. I am tired to wake up every single day, regretting that I did not die in my sleep. Regretting that I have to survive another day while I am already rotting inside. I guess that life doesn't love every person that exists. It would explain tragedies and accidents, and it would explain why some are happy while others suffer. Those lucky enough will be able to enjoy life, but those others will only continue limping towards their true peace.

I was afraid my whole life that I will die alone. That I will be trapped in my own mind with nobody to be there for me. And I guess that this is the only way my life will end no matter what I do. I know people would tell me to only care and think about myself. But I want to be understood too. I can't love myself. No matter how hard I have tried, I cannot bring myself to love me. It's impossible to accomplish when I am aware of the fact that nobody ever loved me either. And if nobody did, why would I? Maybe I am not worth loving. When everyone has the same oppinion on you, then maybe you truly are the problem. So why would you think different?

Though, it does hurt me. I have tried myself to be a good person. I know I wasn't the best, but I wasn't the worst either. I was just human. But for whatever reason, I wasn't treated like a human. Seen as a freak by everyone, abandoned when I was getting attached, isolated from the whole society. My whole existence did not matter to anyone. It was ignored, like a meaningless parasite of the world. How much I have tried to feel like I belong somewhere. Like I found a person that would notice that I am alive too. I didn't ask for love or best friends or a family of my own. Just one single person to notice my existence. To feel like I am alive here as well. But no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up alone in my own thoughts.

I guess that people are right. You can't save everyone. And maybe I wasn't even worth trying to be saved. To be shown that I am human as well. To feel like I am worth something. Like I can do something myself. Maybe in the end, those born as a nobody will forever remain that way. And there is no meaning in trying to change what fate has planned for them.",4,1753776706.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc5pp3/i_wish_i_was_never_born/

I want to kill myself just to be at ease and peace,"Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, why these three elements made their home in me. I have been depressed my whole life, even as a child I couldn't live it perfectly coz of our financial situation and sexual harassment. Back then, I just thought this sexual assault is a game so every time that person asked I would go. Didn't engaged in any other activities, didn't make friends, nothing at all. I know no one going to read this long-long story but I don't know why I wanted to write it here and I have no idea what could that obvious reason be, I just wanna do it. 

 
My first depression episode started when I was giving my final 12th exam but it was not that extreme then, when I got in collage, I made some friends who made my depression worst being soo selfish and always make feel left out and some of other things were there too that made me realize all a man wants is sex, not love not anything and it did hit me so hard. I attempted suicide, but then I saw my parents it made me realize this is not an option I have to be strong and make our life better. Without external help I overcame the depression, I worked hard got a good job bought a house for ourselves - finally we didn't have to live in rented house. We were happy and its been 2 years in our new home. 

But as I think I am cursed I cannot be happy for long, My wedding is scheduled in oct and I have no savings, and what more happened? I lost my job. Everything's falling apart. I cannot enjoy the only thing I will experience once in my life, I have bills to pay, EMIs and more imp wedding. The lay off got me so hard, my depression is triggered again and I am harming myself more than ever now. I am not able to see a future so I just want to be dead or sleep all the time so that I don't have to face the reality. It's been 2 months since my lay off, haven't got even a single offer after applying restlessly day and night. Life is tough, I know they are trails, but I just wanted to be happy at my wedding. Most importantly I can cancel the wedding but what about the home I bought for my family, who will give EMIs, everything's fuckedup.  

Since I am not getting any job, I can still save my house but it requires me dead, just want to know what are some tactics to suicide and make it look natural?  ",2,1753793642.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcani9/i_want_to_kill_myself_just_to_be_at_ease_and_peace/
Worst low I’ve gotten in a long time,A few months ago one of my brothers had a cancer scare ended up failing one of my classes because of the stress. There’s many issues at home I live with my entire family including my eldest brothers family so there’s lots of tension. He takes everything I say a bad way and at any point he’s a Complete asshole to me. I’ve been with my bf for 4 years however he’s hurt me so many times I’ve been trying to end it for the past few months however he’s my only support system other than my mom that I feel I can tell anything to. A few weeks ago my brother asked my mom to pretty much cut me out of any inheritance (I’m adopted btw) and then compared me to someone who isn’t family. I’ve always considered him my brother and hearing this put me into a full spiral realizing that once my parents pass away I’ll have no family left and that someone I’ve considered family doesn’t even think of me the same. Between the family issues and being conflicted with my relationship that i see no future with I’ve stopped feeling anything. I’m also stressed about school and ending up doing nothing with my life. I have friends however it doesn’t feel like they will really be there like my boyfriend has always been. I know I’m being selfish holding onto him but I just feel so numb and don’t want to do anything.

Struggling really hard,"I’m currently a 19 year old college student, I took a gap year right after I finished high school since my mental healthy fully deteriorated, I got myself checked and diagnosed and was given some medication which at first helped me through my gap year, though sometimes of course my depression and anxiety got the better of me and I would feel completely overwhelmed and insecure about myself. I thought I was getting better since I got to do things I couldn’t do like socializing with others without the help of my friends or family, and also going out alone to have some time for myself, but now college season is starting again I just got enrolled, I thought I would do better this year and possibly say my gap year was worth it, but here I am again, my depression came back in full force with my anxiety, even when I’m not thinking about anything my body would show signs that I really am not okay, I’m so insecure now because I can’t afford to take another gap year from the fear of getting really left behind, my cousins are all academically successful and while I am happy for them..I wished I could be happy for myself too..but I’m not, I feel like such a burden to my family..especially because I’m suffering from mental disorders..I just don’t know what to do anymore..sometimes it’s really overwhelming that I just wished I never woke up.",2,1753792587.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mca9dq/struggling_really_hard/

How do I get past my greif,"I am an 18m and within the last few weeks I have felt an immense amount of guilt and I have been left feeling stuck in a perpetual state of numbness and confusion. With the help of medical professionals I have been given a Zoloft prescription that I have started taking within the last week. I am disgusted with myself and I want to grow and get past my guilt. I am responsible for the death of my family dog on behalf of my negligence. I regret not being there to care for him. I am sick to my stomach with how careless I was at the time of his passing, I held I’m in my arms when he died, I can’t begin to imagine the way my dog had felt as he passed away. I know that I should learn from my experience and I feel as if I have failed my dog, my family as well as myself. There are a lot more details that I can provide, but currently I’m not in a good position to talk about it fully. My psychiatrist has told me about therapy for PTSD and other traumas but I don’t know about it. What is EMDR therapy? How does it work? How do I grow and learn to forgive myself? I feel stuck in the past event, I feel haunted by him. People in my life keep telling me how it wasn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel responsible. I find myself isolating myself and withdrawing from my family far more than I had done in the past.  I apologize for the writing in this post being all over the place, I am extremly emotional as I write this, reflecting on what has happened. He died on July 9th of this year and at the time of writing this I am still regretful, and I just don’t know how to progress past this point. I can’t stop thinking about him and how I failed him. I’ve been told continuously that I should forgive myself and try to move forward but no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to get past this weight on my shoulders. I’ve been trying to socialize more with my friends to keep myself out of the house and doing more productive things to help cope. I am writing this in hope of finding people who have had a similar experience of feeling overwhelming guilt and I want to know what you’ve done to cope and manage the feelings of numbness, regret, depression, and guilt. Words cannot even begin to describe how I feel. I find myself going through intense waves of guilt and feeling haunted by the loss of my family dog. Knowing that my family still loves me, and knowing that they don’t blame me and forgive me brings me little comfort, I cannot escape my thoughts lately. I want to atleast learn how to manage so I can get into a better mental health state. I can’t stop hearing his barks at night, and I would sob relentlessly but now I find myself being unable to cry and express my feelings. How do I manage grief? Is there any coping mechanisms That you would be willing to share? Do you have a similar experience? I Just need to know that I’m not alone I want to feel alive again, I want to forgive myself. Please tell me of anything that you can share that may help me.",3,1753782567.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc77fd/how_do_i_get_past_my_greif/
Not sure what the hell crisis this is I’m going through,"I’m turning 34 in a few weeks and I’m going through possibly the worst episode of depression I’ve yet experienced. This time last year I was satisfied with my life, landed a job I always wanted, finished college, travelled across the US. After that passed and I got settled into my job, I feel flat, unmotivated, depressed, annoyed, lost, unsure about everything. I don’t know who I am anymore. It’s hard for me to feel genuine happiness. Any exciting moments I have are fleeting then it’s right back to feeling sad, unhappy, irritated, uncertain. Last year I had the goal of finally graduating college, I had a big vacation trip planned, and I was thrilled to look forward to starting a new job in a field I loved. 

I guess now that I’ve accomplished those things, there’s nothing to look forward to and life feels mundane. I have went on several small trips throughout this summer and I feel small bits of happiness then it all goes away when I come back home. I haven’t been myself lately and have had to take some time away from work to get my health in order. As I’m home from work I’m questioning everything and wondering what the hell I even went out of my life. I don’t feel like I know anything and nothing makes me happy anymore. 

I started this new job and the realities of it and the strict management has made me feel discouraged from continuing in this field. I’m just not sure where to turn and I don’t know what’s going with me. I’ve started therapy and next appointment is in a few days.

I don't understand why I feel this way,"I'm in my 4th year of Law school. I guess it's either the competitiveness, peer pressure or the toxic friend group that I was in from the very beginning that drained me. 

The fact that I'm writing this itself feels unreal to me. It's almost like I don't want to believe that I'm depressed. Or anxious. I get anxious to the point that it affects my speech patterns. My heart races to a point that I can't hear a word anyone's saying and I get nauseous. I'm done with people telling me I need professional help. I know I do. It's just that my parents are conventional minded when it comes to this. 

I don't even feel like going to college. The friend group I was in was weirdly competitive when it came to enrolling in extracurricular activities and they hung out behind my back...like I was shunned...like they didn't wanna be associated with me. And all along I thought I it's becuase I'm weird (Like who wants to associate themselves with a weirdo who's always depressed right?). That's the part that hurt me the most. The fact that I gave up on myself. More than anything else.

(Now I'm in a different friend group where my presence is appreciated and I feel like I'm valued and theirs is all in shambles). 

I don't know why it's hitting me now. My grades have took a huge plunge. I have attendance shortage and what not. 

As they say your environment influences how you behave. I grew up in an environment (My parents are generous and have a helping mentality)  where everyone are givers. My mum I felt like expects getting back atleast 1/10 th of what she gives. My dad is a chill guy tho 😂. As you can see, naturally I inherited their very characteristics. I used to think why they dedicate so much of their energy to people who dgaf about them. (Turns out they're both middle children 😭)

I used to hate their 'giving' mentality. But now...I've become the very thing I hate. And it's taken all my strength to accept the fact that it's not so bad to be a giver. To be like your parents. To not be like your parents. 

To be the side character who gets shuffled to the back of the crowd. To be the one clicks the pictures but never gets clicked. To be alone. To be together.

I know living there isn’t good for me but I don’t have a choice right now.

Expressing emotions in the form of writing.,"I believe writing has the potential to reduce your stress, overthinking, anxiety and in turn depression.
Sometimes anonymous writing helps, when you don't want others to know. Sometimes you just post with your public profile.

Daily journaling or writing a diary helps.

I have build one website ( writeanon (dot) in ) for this purpose. 

Try it out. I would be glad if this helps anyone to reduce some weight from your chest.",1,1753796775.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcbved/expressing_emotions_in_the_form_of_writing/
Is suicide something everyone feels?,"I don’t mean to sound edgy and/or arrogant when I say this

I was playing cards with a few of my friends a few days ago. We were joking around and talking about music. One of my friends asked me if I listened to RadioHead and I half jokingly said “only when I want to kill myself.” Everyone just blankly stared at me, as if I said the craziest thing in the world. I thought I was being relatable and I thought suicide/the urge to not exist anymore was a universal experience. Everyone feels depressed sometimes. Everyone feels anxiety sometimes. Ergo, everyone feels suicidal sometimes. Is this true or am I wrong?",530,1753673922.0,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mb5wuf/is_suicide_something_everyone_feels/
I thought being attractive would make me happy. It doesn’t.,"   I used to be really skinny and kinda ugly in high school. I never really believed I could have a relationship with a girl, and it didn’t really bother me. I was happy, or at least content, playing video games, drinking beer, and delivering pizzas. 

   Fast forward a few years and I guess I had a bit of a glow up. I started working out and eating better, I started wearing more flattering clothes, and my face changed. I’m not sure how to explain it, but when I look at old photos now, my face definitely looks more grown and handsome now. For the first time in my life, I could be considered fairly attractive. I wasn’t aware of this AT ALL. I guess because it’s hard to notice change when it’s so gradual? 

   So I had this coworker. She was a couple years my junior, and she was so so beautiful. I work with a couple older ladies and they all kinda joke that we would be cute together. I would laugh it off always, still maintaining the old idea that no girl would want to be with me. We were kinda flirty though, and so I thought, ‘what the hell,’ and just asked her out one day. She said yes, and I thought she was just being polite. Again, at this point I had no idea that I’m a pretty good looking guy. 

   So we go see a movie and it goes really well; we made out in the theatre and we were laughing and talking and later I dropped her off. For the next few months we text almost nonstop and we see each other at work all the time. We would meet up at night a few times, but other than that, we almost never saw each other outside of work. This was for reasons I don’t really want to get into. 

   Anyway, I learned during our talks that she always thought I was really hot. I want to reiterate that this girl was beautiful. She was really pretty, had an amazing body, she had a bold but cute personality, she was amazing. When she told me she thought I was hot, it completely changed how I saw myself. 

   We were never really dating, but whatever we had ended. I don’t want to get into the details. Afterwards, I felt fine for a while. I had a new confidence in myself. I saw two other girls in the months following that. It actually surprised me how easily I could meet other girls now. The problem was I couldn’t connect with any of them and I didn’t know why. I stopped seeing the girl I was seeing, and I couldn’t really explain to her why I wanted to end it. I just left. 

   And then this sadness entered my life. Overwhelming, crushing sadness. Like nothing I’d ever felt before, ever. At first it was so intense I didn’t know what to do. I would just ball up in my bed and sob because I literally didn’t know what else to do, the feeling was so awful. 

   I thought this feeling was a symptom of grief for losing the first girl, but it’s been so long. And I still feel like this all the time. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. 

   Fast forward a few months, and now I’m here. I haven’t met anyone new, and I’m not trying to. I’m afraid to. I’ve been trying to understand my emotions better, and over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed I haven’t really been sad. However, I haven’t been happy either, or angry, or anything. I’ve just kind of felt numb. I think maybe I’ve been bottling up my emotions subconsciously, because the other night I bawled my eyes out for no apparent reason. Nothing really bad happened that day, so I don’t know why I felt like that. 

   Anyways, I just thought writing down my thoughts would maybe make me feel better. Realistically I think I need therapy. I’m not sure if I’m depressed, but I’m trying every day to understand myself better. Peace and love be with you all.

"I dont know, I just needed to put it somewhere else other than in me.","
No matter how hard I try, all my might and grit arent enough stop be from being here.  Its quiet now all the time- i wake up to nothing and I return home to a half life.

Its all gone, the stitching has unfurled.  This hell is sweet; it exists because of love. 

I hate this place. 

I wish for peace. For  rest and for silence, there was a time I tasted pieces of each- but never a full plate.  

Was i ever real?, was anything?, were you?.  

I see proof; screenshots of messages so I wouldnt forget things loved and wanted; I was once among them.

After so much death to have such little light steal itself away from me?- maybe I am the things ive been told.  I know im not all bad- I just dont have the reminder.

The bed is warm and lonley, the kitchen table has four chairs  only one  is ever used.   I sit i wait and watch the sun through the window.  3 months so far- to me you were lost yesterday; I wonder if you could remember me- would you even choose to?.  Am I  cursed to carry another weight forever?, will i withstand and endure the sand filled winds at the edge of that pit or is it to strong finally. 

My heart splintered, parts vanquished and fetitd  full of rot- it isnt a new fact but the taste is getting to me.  

I've buried, pets friends, parents and now I have to find a way to mourn you in some new way. 
 How can i mourn the loss of light when its hard to rememeber its warmth?. 

You gave me hope, you dashed it in a manner of seconds; one decision- years gone never to return.

I miss you, I love you , my sweet girl. ",1,1753795963.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mcbjvv/i_dont_know_i_just_needed_to_put_it_somewhere/
I kind of tried to kill myself,"Through out my life I've always wanted to disappear, therefore I always had suicide in my mind. I've never really tried, I always did these little things like ""if I have to take 1 pill l'll take 3-4 more, hopefully I die"". Recently I've had more of these thoughts or actions, but I don't really do it because I can't find a ""method"" and I don't want to bring more problems to my family by doing it. 
Yesterday I went to the bath and opened the water, I have had this thought about drowning some days ago, so I just wanted to know how it felt, you know, just another ""I'm not trying to kill myself, but I hope it kind of works ig"" let the water run through the bathtub, then I just lied down in the bathtub and I felt so peaceful, even though I had some thoughts. After I while of waiting I check the water, well, it didn't filled, then I remember my bathtub never worked that well for the bathtub, so we always use the shower. I hoped for the water to not go, I even put my feet in the drain, it didn't work. These days I think a lot about suicide, when I'm about to sleep, in my daily routine, even when I'm at work and I see these high structures. It is not as bad as it sounds, it may been happening for about a week maybe.
Anyways, I just wondered what these kind of thoughts are, or what happened with me, I'm kind of confused.",4,1753764286.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc2di6/i_kind_of_tried_to_kill_myself/

FUCK, vad jag hatar att jag vart född i en fattig familj, som har skulder.

hur håller folk ens sig motiverade till att vilja va en ekorre åt någon annan? Det kanske inte känns så för dig...  
Men för mig känns det som att jag är en kossa om jag skulle välja att arbeta, i 08-17 världen.

det är också förståeligt att dom som har arbetat hårt, att komma upp till världen där dom kan anställa folk, att dom inte vill ha folk som är gnälliga och orutinerad och att dom inte kommer, ge belöning åt människor som är lata, det förstår ju vem som helst.

"I don’t want to romanticize Depression, but","I’ve been depressed since I was young. And the past few years has been the best times of my life thanks to my husband. We’ve dated back in high school and rekindled. He helps keep me grounded and reminds me to stay present. He literally knows me in and out. I’m in the healthiest relationship I could ever imagined and he’s so understanding. 

But I always find myself finding comfort in my depression through music or sad things in general to get me in the mood. (Or I just crave it) I know it’s not healthy, but it feels like a security blanket. Odd I know.. I don’t stay in it for long, but a few days in it and I have to remind myself at times to bounce back and I feel better after. 😅. 

In our conversation: him “Do you thrive in depression?”  

Me “I do.. it’s like a drug that runs through my veins..
It has become part of me.”

And I know depression is a silent struggle and how lonely it can get. As humans we still crave human interactions and understanding. 

I’m just wondering if it’s just me or does anyone else find comfort from their depression.

I'm Depressed and don't now what to do?,"So I passed out from Tier-3 Engineering College which is worse than men washroom. There's no teachers/faculties, it's really poor and we can't afford private institutions so well....In that college we have to maintain attendance over 75% even though faculties will be absent more often than students and by faculty I mean guys sitting on examination shell & fee counter.  
I never got that attendance so they never gave me internal marks more than 40/50 it were like 30/50, 31/50, 26/50 and yes below 30, it's internal back for which I need to get least 34 marks out of 100 in externals and well I did not pass Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering in 1st year.  
I got 4 more backs in 2nd year but 3rd and 4th year I focused on progress and got no back although I cleared 2nd year's back.  
now I'm passed out last month, I finished final examination and attended back paper examination for Engineering-Math-II & Basic-Mechanical-Engineering from 1st year and results are out.  
Of course I passed my all 4th year subjects maintaining CGPA over 6 but but but, guess what.

**I FAILED IN BOTH MATHS AND MECHANICAL AGAINNNN!**

Not like I didn't studied dude it's fucking 4th year and I'm poor, I'm stressed for job, I'm busy learning CSE skills for job, I'm busy studying subject I need to and why do I need to pass Basic-Mechanical-Engineering anyway for Software-Developer-Role?

*They gave me like 0.5 or 1 marks on 3-4 page 10 marks answer.*

I can't get degree without it, I'm afraid to tell my parents, I have job pressure already and now I'm depressed.

is there something inherently wrong with me,"16f. I've never really been much of an introvert (though I try to avoid going out when I can). I make friends pretty easily and I can talk to most people, yet I'm struggling in my relationships. Many of my friends in school have been actively leaving me out of activities and conversations. I feel like an accessory to most groups and my presence feels expendable. I don't get into drama, I don't talk shit about anyone I'm friends with, and I overcompensate by taking on their habits of speaking, humor, and interests so they can like me a bit more. As I went into high school, I molded myself to become more appealing to people and I made a lot of friends, yet all that effort feels ultimately futile. I don't belong anywhere I go, not since the day I was born. I'm the black sheep of my family (yes, even as an only child), the stain in my friend groups, and the one floater everybody goes to when their ""actual"" friends can be with them. I only have one really good friend, but she lives in a different state. Even then, she always talks about how close she is with her boyfriend and other best friends and I can't help but feel worse and even lonelier.

Even simple interactions with people are tiresome and trite. Every conversation I have with people feels like small talk. I don't enjoy anything. I try so hard, but I can't feel fulfilled by any conversation I have with them. It feels like time dilates, and I can feel my mind materialize and piece together huge rifts between me and everybody else. I'm missing something that makes them click--something that I don't have.

A lot of this has manifested into deep insecurities about my own faculties. I feel much less accomplished, talented, pretty, intelligent, witty, and charismatic than everybody else around me. I feel like a shell of a human being with no outstanding traits. I have my own interests, my own identity, and a good idea as my standing as a human being--yet I can't help but feel inadequate/emptier to everybody else. Talents I thought I had, and a vision for a future that I manifested for so long, seem to be slipping through my fingers like an inviscid liquid. I feel like nothing, I feel like I am a nobody. I can't achieve anything.

I don't like feeling this way. I don't know what to do. My therapist, my parents, and my best friend don't understand me and they don't give me any solutions or steps. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just a naturally a socially inept person? My mom and dad say I'm incredibly sarcastic wording on rude, but that's how a lot of my ""friends"" at school talk to me too. Or it is just my lack of admirable traits? I've noticed that all the more academically high achieving people and conventionally attractive people tend to accumulate friends very easily. My therapist, my friend, and my parents have all said that it's not my fault but if its happening within every social group I'm in, there has to be a common denominator, right?

All I do is wake up at 4am go to work clock out go to the gym, eat a small meal, shower and sleep the same thing over and over again. I went out last Saturday with my friends for her birthday she wanted to see a DJ. So I went I was DD I didn't drink and while I was there in that room full of people pretending to have fun all I felt was empty and overwhelmed, exhausted like what am I even doing here I don't wanna be here. Everyday I wake and tell myself today is the day that I will do it but l never can find the will to actually go through with it. I cry myself to sleep till I am exhausted and can no longer cry. I think to myself of the various ways I can go about ending it. I could hop on my car and drive off to the middle of nowhere and hang myself obviously before I do that l'd break my phone so that no one can find me. I’m just exhausted a month ago I was drinking and my drink got spiked and I OD I was dead and the doctor resuscitated me. I I know should be happy that God gave me another chance, but I can’t help but feel mad because during that moment, it was like I was in some deep sleep. I was finally at peace. I was resting and now I’m back to this endless cycle that I call live. I’m stressed exhausted tired and I have a $14,000 medical bill can’t help but think how I wish I would’ve stayed done and I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m just to a point where I’m tired and I feel like any day now I just might go ahead and do it",1,1753790882.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc9nok/im_exhausted/
One of those nights,"
I feel like every other day I’m having like this weird reality check that this is my life. That I’m really a 24 year old with a dead mom and a father that’s never been in my life . Which at this point I truly don’t know even know if he’s alive. Like I can’t believe there is someone on this earth that I came from that wants nothing to do with me that I wouldn’t recognize if I passed by them, a complete stranger. It makes you wonder if my own father doesn’t even want me who would? Is this normal? was this something I was supposed to normalize and pretend like I can still have a good life . When I feel so isolated from literally every other human being. I feel so disconnected. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. When I’m working I feel responsible like an adult. When I’m distracted. When I have time to breathe I feel like a lost child. When I have time to take In my reality I’d rather be anywhere else than in my own body. I’m extremely delayed it’s like I’m always this 15 year old. No confidence , wanting to go unnoticed but be seen as “normal” embarrassed of my family dynamic. Never feeling like I’m valuable, likable enough. Then I get older and older and before I know it I’ll be 48 still feeling like that 15 year old. My mom died at 48 I hope I die sooner. I don’t have anything to do here but suffer. To be used and get nothing in return. Just feeling like the 15 year old that no wanted after mom died . Now I’m the 24 year old that people still don’t want. ",3,1753769390.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3txa/one_of_those_nights/
"Went back on Prozac, feel unmotivated and awful about how my life is going (RANT)","This is more of a rant post. I feel like not a lot of people in my life really get what I'm going through. 

Like they know what depression's like, but not clinical. The type where nothing has to happen, or a small disturbance can trigger it. I've been depressed since I was 8, I'm 21 now. I didn't know at the time that I had depression, but I can look back on it and confirm that I did have it. 

I was bullied a lot growing up, I moved to 8 schools probably more in my childhood. I was isolated from others in 4 schools, bullied in 4 schools. From family, teachers, people who I thought were my friends, classmates, and just random people. I was always the target of someone's aggression. I stayed inside most of my childhood, maladaptive daydreaming to avoid the real world. My mom was a single mom, she worked two jobs most of my life and when I was 13 she started going to school and working. So in both instances, I didn't see her much. So on most days I was alone, or being 'babysat' by a relative, but really I would just go in my room and only come out when it was time to eat. I'd spend days being mute, not talking to anyone besides a ""hi"" to my relative(s) or my mom. In school, I would go days without saying anything because I couldn't relate to them, nobody made me feel safe. My muteness got better, I was able to be more social from middle school to high school. But I still had problems at school and was maladaptive daydreaming to cope with it. I was verbally, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused growing up. I was blackmailed into having sex with a boy who I thought was my friend for 1 year. It really messed me up. I was exploited only by pedophiles as a child online. I just wanted love. So I showed my body a lot when I was 12 - 18. Even though I didn't like the sex, and in all honesty, I do think I'm a lesbian, I thought that was the only way people could love me. Because I felt so ugly in school, the majority of the schools I went to, I was told I was ugly. I struggle so much with my weight now because I don't want to go back to being 'ugly' again. I've crash-dieted many times, my worth was tied to a scale for many years. 

  
I dropped out in my senior year of high school because I couldn't take the bullying anymore and got my GED. I went to college with a bang, made friends, lost a lot of weight, had a boyfriend, and was doing good in college. Everything was going great until it wasn't. I lost all those friends, gained weight, my ex-boyfriend was sexually abusive, and I have no drive to complete my education. I'm only still here because I'm a senior in college, and the political state of the world makes me feel I would be screwing myself over if I take a gap year or pursue a job not related to my major.

The depression I felt doubled in April. I don't know what came over me. I left the gym, and something told me to just start driving really fast, so I did. I was passing a lot of people and speeding, passing people over solid lines. For the first time in almost a year, I'd felt adrenaline. A high that I missed so much that I kept passing people and driving erratically despite knowing I should stop. I had a green light, and a guy was turning left, thinking only he had the green. I was going too fast to react, so all I could do was slam on the brakes. He crashed right into my driver's side. Nobody died; I had minor injuries. But I felt so shitty. The people who crashed into me kept yelling at me that they had a green light and that they had a dashcam, the mother of the driver shoved a camera/or dashcam Idk what it was, in my face when I was at the hospital. Overall just being really aggressive and not helping the situation. And a witness decided they wanted to come forward about my reckless driving before the accident, even though he admitted that he did not see the accident happen. My mom is in debt due to the accident. My car was totaled. She already works day and night, and I gave her more trouble because of this ""feeling"" or ""adrenaline"". I don't have a car. I feel like a failure in life on most days. 

I was on Prozac in May, and went off because I ran out of medication. I stayed off because I hated the side effects from the Prozac, like the low motivation and suicidal ideation. And in general, didn't have the motivation to go and get the medicine. I don't know why I just kept pushing it off. I only took it this time around because my mom said she wouldn't let me drive since I'm not taking my medication and that I'm a danger to myself and others on the road. I got the prozac yesterday, and since taking it I have such low motivation. I only had enough strength to cook myself breakfast, I've just been sitting and laying down in silence all day. I often space out and think about how sad my life was for hours on end.

On a lot of days, I think of just ending my life. I didn't have a childhood; I barely had a young adulthood. Is this what life has to offer me? I'll get a job after I graduate, and then what? Work for the rest of my life? That doesn't sound appealing to me. But I don't exactly have the funds or resources to go and live in the woods comfortably away from everyone. I have a promising career in psychology as a researcher. I've been told this many times by many different people. But I wish they'd just forget I existed and give that opportunity to someone else, because then I wouldn't feel guilty turning it down. I'm not in the best mindset to make decisions, which is why I've just been going along with what people are telling me to do now. Because if it were up to me, my life would be worse off.",1,1753790623.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc9kka/went_back_on_prozac_feel_unmotivated_and_awful/
Struggling rn,"I am a child abuse survivor. My parents had substance use issues as well as depressive tendencies. I was basically ignored or abused my whole childhood. I have adhd and didn't get the support I needed so I didn't do well in school. My older sister was the one they wanted.  

I basically planned to cut them out of my life since I was 6. I moved out, got my life together, managed to start a career and found a way to survive when I thought that would be impossible for someone like me. I'm married to a guy that treats me well and though our relationship isn't perfect, when we have problems he's on my team and willing to work on it with me. No kids, I didn't want any, then he didn't want any, now we're both considering it but circumstances and finances scare us. I spent a lot of my childhood lonely and friendless. But I even have friends now that I see every weekend.  

My grandpa passed and left me enough money to get a down payment on a house. A stable safe home was what I dreamed of having someday. It's what kept me pushing forward through all the hard times and academic bullshit. Interest rates are high but with our combined income we can make our mortgage payments. I work two jobs. Husbands job is really nice and pays for our health insurance.  

But it feels like something inside me broke once I got what I wanted more than anything in life. I have a house, but I'm not happy. I feel empty. Times are uncertain and I may get laid off, and in our city the major employer is letting people go. I've been trying to find a better job already so I don't have to work 2, but it's been a year, 3 interviews and nothing. I'm unsure if the skills I have are good enough now that there's ai. I'm so tired now. It makes me wonder what is the point? If this all wasn't enough for me, why am I trying so hard? Will I ever be happy?  

I can feel my therapist getting frustrated with me. She's seen me pull through worse stuff than this without feeling hopeless. But back then I had my dream home to look forward to someday at the end of it all. And I feel lost and directionless now that I have it and I feel less certain of my future than ever. I know I did all those things to get here. I should be resilient enough to survive whatever happens in life and I know that any life I make for myself could be a good one. But that part of me feels so far away. Like I can't be that anymore. What's wrong with me?",3,1753768924.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3pk0/struggling_rn/
I don’t want to attend my sister’s wedding….,"Growing up, my mother always seemed to favor my older sister over me and my other sister. From the way my older sister was treated compared to us, it was easy to think that she was better in every way and was destined for great things. She always excelled in school and the arts. She has a lot of friends and is undeniably the most beautiful out of all the siblings. I hate to admit it, but it always hurt me to see her succeed. It’s always seemed like she’s living life on easy mode. I’ve seen her have her moments, but she bounces back so quickly. And she never had a problem getting a man. Me, on the other hand, have had the worst luck in love. 

There was no doubt in my mind she would find somebody. Of course it ended up being a handsome 23 year old with a successful career. She met him when she moved to Ohio for school and the rest is history. I always hated when she’d come to visit because it constantly reminded me that I had nobody. I don’t hate my sister, I just hate that she has everything I want: a thriving school life, large group of loyal friends, the perfect boyfriend. 

I hate that I do this when I’m emotional, but in my moments of breaking down, I often wished she would eventually end up single again like me so I wouldn’t feel so ashamed that I didn’t have anybody. Well, recently they got engaged, and I locked myself in my room and cried until I was blind from rage/distress. 

Everyone in my family is gushing about their wedding plans and how magical it’s going to be, while I’m dreading when that day comes in about a year. I don’t want to be there, not because I have any ill will towards her or her boyfriend, but because I don’t want to ruin her special day by being a depressed and miserable wreck. 

I know she probably wants me there for support, but I can’t help but think I’ll be a burden. I just couldn’t handle it. She deserves to have a stress free day. I’ll just stay home and get drunk I guess. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my sister. I just don’t understand why it seems like everything goes right for her and my life has just been me constantly contemplating suicide. ",4,1753758821.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc0n4q/i_dont_want_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/

"hi. i hate myself, and want to die.","i've self-harmed since i was 14. i don't remember why i started. i think i've just always hated myself. the way i look, sound, act. 

i've never had big family issues. a few fights with my grandfather, but i always respected him. when i still lived with them, my older sibling never learned how to drive so i was stuck driving them to school when my dad wasn't able to, limiting time i could spend working or just doing other things - that was pretty annoying. even now they bother me a lot with tech advice they would be better off just looking up, and they always ask at the worst times like when i'm really busy at work. i feel bad for thinking of them as useless at times, since i know they've dealt with similar mental struggles, but i can't help it. anyway, it didn't help - but wasn't the instigator since that was well after i started cutting myself anyway.

i was pretty good in school until the end of high school. at that point i felt pretty committed to being a content creator, so i was just trying to graduate and move on. barely did, and moved onto community college - dropped out after two years. went okay for a bit, but eventually my motivation completely died, started failing classes and eventually just stopped going entirely. self-harm only got worse throughout. content creation never worked out, but that's fine - it sounds like a miserable job nowadays anyway.

my first job was working a small gas station for a grocery store. somehow, i hated it. it'd be 8 hours to myself, not doing much for the most part. i'd bring my switch and played a lot of fire emblem and animal crossing. it should've been fine, should've been easy, but i somehow found a way to make it worse. i hated whenever people payed with anything but a card, for some reason - despite only taking a few seconds to deal with them. i don't understand why, but it made me so angry. maybe it was because i had brought a game to play, and they were ""taking me away from it,"" despite it being my job. i don't know. brains fucked. still did that for 6 years though, for some reason. somewhere in that time i started to burn myself alongside cutting myself plenty.

not gonna say what i do now, but it is a lot better. my boss can be pretty stubborn and stupid sometimes, and that's leading to a lot of stress right now. for a few years i didn't cut myself as much, just every few months i'd go a bit crazy to let it all out. i think the recent stress is really getting to me cause i'm back to cutting/burning every day, but oh well.

i still hate myself. i still think about killing myself all the time. i'm surprised none of my wounds have ever gottten infected, since i do next to nothing to actually treat them. some of my roomates know about this, but they haven't said anything about it in years. they were only ever really aware because of a vent twitter i had, but i deleted that ages ago - so from their perspective, everything is probably fine now. i always feel like i'm just one really bad day away from offing myself.

writing this, my life really hasn't seemed that bad - and that just makes me feel worse for all this. other people have had it so much worse, and here i am with a generally pretty good life making the worst decisions possible. guess i'm just a naturally useless piece of shit, huh?",3,1753768478.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc3kzs/hi_i_hate_myself_and_want_to_die/
got into clinic for adults as a 19 year old,"After waiting forever, I got a spot in a psychosomatic clinic today, starting in two months. However, I only turned 19 and originally wanted to get into a clinic for young people (under 25) and am now kinda scared, I don’t feel adult and feel 1000 times more comfortable around people my age, I’m basically still a teenager. I mean, I was at least hoping to feel comfortable there and maybe talk with someone my age but now there might just be people over 40 or 50 there. They’re people who probably already got a job, and already raised kids my age so we definitely won’t be on the same wavelength, and I’m scared they’ll look down onto my struggles(say something like I haven’t experienced adult life and it will only get actually bad in the future, and I have nothing to be depressed about and basically invalidate my feelings). And I heard that even if the clinic is bad, it’s the people that can make the stay not so bad, I was hoping to maybe even make some friends, but what if they’re all twice my age or more, I don’t think I’ll be getting along with them much.

Being sick is incredibly isolating,"My (21m) depression skyrockets when I'm sick. Maybe this is just a me thing but getting sick just tanks my mental state and makes me way more emotional than normal. It's just such a crushing feeling, wanting to use ur body but ur too weak to move it, wanting to use your voice but it's painful to speak, wanting to be near someone but being avoided because who knows if it's contagious? There is nothing I want more than to be held and told that it'll be okay, I'll start feeling better soon and they'll be right there with me the whole time. But I don't have someone I'm that close with, and even if I did, I probably wouldn't ask. I'd feel too guilty that I might get them sick and I couldn't possibly put them through what I'm feeling now.

It’s been so long since I rant my emotion,"hey, I haven’t had any emotional distress or depression since I left my uni to do my internship. 6 months passed and today, it just happened :)

Sometimes I wonder if I’m the only person who gives energy to my friends. Whenever they rant or anything, I would always reply. But no one do the same for me. It kind of triggered me today and I just felt helpless.

It also doesn’t help for a fact that in my internship office, the interns dont share what are they talking about. I just feel stressed today

I know I don’t have the intelligent but I wish they would ask me more. 

I felt useless, idiotic, I don’t understand why I am still alive. I keep wanting to hang myself but of course I part of my brain won’t do it. I’m using this community to calm myself down as I’ve been distressed for the past few hours.

Is it even worth trying at this point?,"What's the point of living if I'm a depressed, overweight, socially awkward 36 year old virgin with a shitty, dead end job, living in a rundown apartment, and barely making it paycheck to paycheck? I was given opportunities when I was younger that many can only dream of but anytime I had a chance to do something, anything, I chose the safe (cowardly) option of doing nothing. Now I don't have that choice anymore. I'm too tired and too old (yes, 36 is too old to be finally getting your shit together). Even if I did have the chance to fix things, I'd fuck that up too. All I can do now is look back at my past with regret until the end comes.",4,1753754703.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbz93r/is_it_even_worth_trying_at_this_point/
How do I help my partner?,"Hi there (I'm using a throwaway account because my partner uses reddit and we follow each other, I don't want him to see this. I'm not a bot, I promise). I am looking for advice/stories/experiences/really any insight from anybody who has been in a similar situation, on either side. 

 
I (mid 20's F) have been with my partner (early 30's, M) for about 3 years now, and we've known each other for around 5-6 years total. We both have our own struggles with mental health, which we have both made steps to improve over the years. I am in a fairly good place, my depression tends to be cyclical, with a bad week coming up every couple of months or so, but I'm doing much better than I used to be. We just moved into a new rental house, which is the most space we've had in years. I have part-time job while also studying from home full-time as I work towards my Bachelor's degree. 


My partner hasn't had a steady job in the past 2-3 years. His mental health ruined his previous employment, and he has done a pre-trade course but has been unable to land a job in that industry, (not for a lack of trying on his part). He has hit a bit of a slump in the past 6 months or so. He was doing well for a while, motivated to learn and grow his skill set, and expand on his hobbies and interests, which he spends a good chunk of his time doing. But that motivation has faded. 


I want to make it clear that his lack of employment is not an issue for me, he pays his half of the rent and all of the bills, and I don't believe having a job is a big indicator of someone's personality, worth, or drive. 


My issue is that I don't know how to help him. I take care of the house, and the groceries, and planning dates and outings, on top of working and studying and caring for my parents and maintaining my social relationships. It's a lot. 


And it hurts. My heart hurts all the time because I can see he's in pain. I try to be there for him to lean on and talk to as much as I can, and he does talk about it. But I hear about how useless he feels, and how sad and full of despair and self-hatred he is. And it hurts so much. I don't know what to do. 


He is in therapy, he is on medication (has a review coming up to potentially up the dosage or explore new options), he is trying. I see him trying so hard and he feels like he's getting nowhere and I don't know how to help. I don't know how to make it better, or even stop it getting worse. 


He doesn't take it out on me, he tells me often how much he loves and appreciates me and everything I do, and he's there for me whenever I need or want anything at all. 


But I can't take away his pain, and that's all I want to do. Every day I see the person I love suffering, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. 


I feel useless, frustrated, angry at the world and the situation we find ourselves in. I'm so sad and so tired all of the time, but I keep going because I can't be the reason this all falls apart. I can't give him another reason why everything sucks. 

Before anyone suggests it, I am not going to leave him. He's been there for me when I was falling apart, and I'm going to do the same for him. 


I just need someone to tell me it's going to be okay, tell me how things got better for you, or what you found that made any sort of difference. Please tell me. Thank you. ",3,1753764456.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc2fc6/how_do_i_help_my_partner/
I need help,"I keep having dreams of committing suicide. I have a regret of telling my friends and my mother that I am depressed, therapy doesn't work, I'm convinced I've gotten so used to my meds that they don't work anymore, my friends think it's cowardice to commit suicide despite the fact that I've told them about wanting to try it. Not to mention the one and only person that I've told my struggles to, as great as he is, I feel a level of regret telling him as well. He hasn't done anything bad but I'm not the type to talk about how I feel to people. Last night I had a dream that I was in my kitchen and I had a gun pointed to my head, everyone I knew was trying to stop me from pulling the trigger, but I did anyways. Part of me wishes it was a reality, minus the part where everyone I knew tried to stop me, I don't want to be stopped honestly, I wish it was a real thing that happened. I die, I don't want a funeral, nor be cremated, just let me rot by myself. Sorry if I sound dramatic and the fact that this post was a long one, but I am genuinely trying to change but I don't see it working at all.

I am at my lowest,"I (M15) am at my lowest ever right now. I know that some people will say that cant be true because I am still Young but in the last time Happend so much shit that I cant comprehend.
At the begining of the Summer holydays I went to a Party with some of my Friends and my girlfriend. She lives in another Country so I dont See her often, but she was at her Friends House this time(one of my Friends). At the Party we were pretty drunk and we kissed and made out.

A week later my sister turned 18 and invited her and my Friends to her Party. I thought this Would be just another Nice Party where me and my gf has some fun, but when she was there she did Not even look at me. 3 Hours in I realised that she did Not want anything to do with me anymore which my Friends confirmed. 
I then downed Shot After Shot and quicly became so drunk that I couldnt read anything because it was so blurry. After some time doing this she came up to me and Said that she was sorry for that and that she did Not feel anything while Kissing and making out. So that is how She broke up with me. 

Around this Moment a colleague from work came by, who I was good with and we talked for a Bit.
I have a very pretty friend but she is in my class so I Would Never Date her(the one my gf is staying). But she Loves to Party and Drink. The Problem is she always Drinks so much that she is Not able to realise what is happening and so she cannot defend herself from people who want to touch her. She also does Not remember anything the next Day when she is drunk.
My colleague knows this and just focused on her.
Because I was to drunk to protect her from him he used his Chance to take her with him somewhere and rape her. 

And now I make myself alligations that it was all my fault and I should have been able to protect her. 
Because of These two things I am now Highlight depressed and am thinking to end my life. 
Everything Reminds me of my ex gf and because the dude who raped my friend is my colleague I have to See him quite often and he has the nerves to joke about it and to Talk disgusting and Bad about her.

"25F, burned out with no desire to try anymore.","Hi all. As the title says, I’m a 25F, with barely any motivation to keep on keeping on. I was a gifted kid. Always had energy & motivation to work hard in school. Played on competitive sports teams all throughout middle school & high-school. Went to college, got my Bachelor’s like I was supposed to. Only for my first job to drain the ever-living fuck out of me. Got a new mostly remote job (in accounting), and I still feel the effects. I work from home 4/5 days/week which is great, but the job itself is already overwhelming. Actually, everything else outside of this job feels overwhelming. I no longer want to socialize on the weekends. I’m far too mentally drained to socialize during the weekdays so I mostly self-isolate now. I used to love working out, and now I haven’t seen a gym in years. I’ve gotten to the point where pretty much everything feels pointless. As a result, I’ve become extremely lazy and disorganized, and the only time I feel relieved from stress is when I drink, which is pretty much everyday now. All I do on the weekends is stay at home & sleep and drink with my boyfriend. I feel awful about this, because he suggests things we could do, but all I want to do is stay in bed with him. He deserves better.

Logically, I know I should just get a new job or switch careers, but even that feels exhausting right now, especially with how the job market is. Even if I did, I’m starting to feel like the whole 9-5 corporate bullshit just isn’t for me. Life has to be more than staring at a screen for 40 hours/week. I have no passion for anything anymore. Week by week, the feeling just gets worse. While I would never end it (can’t hurt my loved ones), at night I’ve started to pray for the universe/god to take me in my sleep because then I would truly be at peace. I genuinely don’t know how to fix this, because this tiredness isn’t something that sleep can fix and trust me, I’ve tried. I don’t know where to go from here, because I want to get better and love life again, but it’s like my mind & body won’t let me. 

Any advice or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",4,1753751502.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mby4lz/25f_burned_out_with_no_desire_to_try_anymore/

"I get suicidal depressed when i orgasm, why?","It's worse when I masturbate, I can get panic attacks and get seriously suicidal, but it was uncomfortable even when I was with my ex, to the point I stopped orgasming when having sex, I would hold myself back whenever I could and feel seriously disappointed when I couldn't hold myself back..

This has been going on for a lot of time, probably since the first time I masturbated, but the link has been clear only lately.. I had an amazing month, I masturbated one time and I got suicidal back again. I found out that with porn is worse, but it's bad even without it. With sex sometimes is fine, usually is not.

I think it can be tied to PTSD? Pheraps sexual trauma I don't remember? I have definitely abandonment trauma tho.
I can't really enjoy my sexuality most of the times. Sometimes it is fine, but most of the times it is like that..

I missed the times when I was strong and not fat, and the times I cared for myself, but now I ruined that, and I know I can't bring it back. My depression is coming back, and my depression can get very bad

"Мне 18, и я не хочу больше существовать","впервые выскажу всё что копилось на душе годами, наверное глупо это делать здесь, но не думаю что кому-то из моих знакомых это надо. я родилась в достаточно бедной по сегодняшним меркам семье, не то чтобы у нас не было на еду, наоборот, всего необходимого в достатке, но что-то дорогое никогда не могли себе позволить, к примеру поездку на море даже в нашей стране. изначально в нашей семье кроме меня была бабушка и моя мама, отец умер через несколько месяцев после того как мне исполнился год. мама в скоре попала в аварию и стала инвалидом второй группы, ей приписали ревматоидный артрит из-за чего она постоянно нахрамывала, со временем от постоянного приема разных медикаментов её здоровье начало ухудшаться, камни в желчном, сердце, проблемы с желудком и печенью, катаракта на обоих глазах, да я даже не помню всего что у неё сейчас есть. но вернёмся к детству, по приходу в садик я поняла что как-то отличаюсь от остальных детей, которых приводили и забирали мама с папой, поскольку у меня это была только бабушка, на всех мероприятиях в дет.саде тоже была только она, я смотрела на других детей которые радовались при виде своих родителей и не понимала почему у меня не так, что со мной не так. несомненно я тоже радовалась когда видела бабушку, но это другое ощущение, ведь так? они радостно прыгали папе на руки, мама целовала их в щёку, а меня просто забирали, без всего этого. зимой после сада мы шли на остановку и ждали автобус часа полтора, когда было теплее туда и обратно добирались на велике. а приходя домой я видела маму скажем так, изуродованную. тело не могло выглядеть на её возраст, поэтому в 35 она выглядела на 50 и так далее. всегда завидовала детям у которых здоровые и красивые мамы, с которыми они могут побеситься или к примеру съездить куда нибудь. конечно у меня есть уважение к своей матери, но люблю ли я её? не думаю. время от времени меня могли бить если я сильно где-то напартачу, а если при этом я начинала плакать говорили не делать этого иначе ещё и за слёзы добавят. каждый вечер мама с бабушкой ссорились на кухне и каждый раз всё начиналось с ничего, каждый вечер они повторяли одни и те же фразы, настолько что я могу пересказать дословно все их ссоры. и вот мне 12, мы живём на минималку в Украине, в доме где не проведена вода и опадает глина с потолка оттого что крыша протекает и она размокает. я уже полностью поняла что моя семья отличается от всех остальных, я стыжусь своей матери и своих условий, не привожу домой друзей чтобы все думали что у меня всё так у других. я не выросла ребеноком паинькой, наоборот, если мне что-то запрещали, делала на зло та и вообще мои подростковые годы прошли в постоянном бунте, поскольку меня всегда опекали, если я задерживалась с друзьями на улице бабушка шла и забирала меня домой под предлогом что они переживают, при этом я гуляла в селе в нескольких домах от моего. после каждого такого раза я устраивала скандал, мол что я сама разберусь до скольки мне гулять. в школе у меня была подруга к которой я ездила на ночёвки и могла проводить там недели, я точно знала что её родители не против этого, поскольку она жила в селе где было пять домов и во всех были пенсионеры, они хотели чтобы их дочь проводила время с одногодками не только в школьные будни. мне могли звонить раз 50 за день, на что я просто отключала телефон, оттуда ведь она меня всё равно не заберёт поскольку не знает где это. а у этой подруги назовем её Лера были достаточно молодые родители, было то о чем я всегда мечтала и в те моменты когда я могла как-то по детски баловаться вместе с ней с её отцом были для меня чем-то новым, чем-то что приносит тепло и одновременно режет сердце. дома же после каждой такой поездки меня ждал грандиозный скандал, мать всегда говорила что она переживает, что ей плохо от этих переживаний, мол я хочу довести её до смерти. и когда-то в детстве я за что-то очень разозлилась на мать, когда она кричала на меня я в порыве гнева сказала ей «мне не нужна мать которая лазит» конечно это ударило по ней, услышать такое от своего ребенка это ужас. и вот почти каждый такой грандиозный скандал она напоминала мне об этом, несмотря на то что я тысячу раз извинилась за это, несмотря что прошло уже много лет, говорила что я наверняка хочу такую мать как у Леры и если так то я могу идти обратно туда, мне ничего не оставалось как всё отрицать, но она была права. позже Лера переехала в город и я тесно общалась с другой девочкой назовем её Диана. в то же время бабушка начала постепенно сходить с ума, сначала это было что-то мелкое, мол забыла куда положила деньги, телефон и всякие мелочи, постепенно это превращалось в забыла куда шла или же своё имя. у меня постоянно пропадали вещи которые она брала от чего я бесилась ещё сильнее, у неё была привычка перекладывать их либо же вообще выносить во двор в сарай, вроде бы ничего такого, но когда ты живёшь в постоянном хаосе, где не можешь элементарно найти свою одежду или предметы гигиены начинает действительно постепенно ехать крыша. мать же будто бы не понимала что бабушка психологически больна, она продолжала с ней ссориться, продолжала винить во всём меня или её. от постоянного какого-то стресса либо психологического давления я начинала быть всё агрессивнее, но что мать что бабушка могли сесть напротив меня и часами говорить обо мне всякий бред. мне бы было ещё нормально если бы не последнее, всю обиду и злость копившуюся во мне я могла выместить физически, разбить что-то или ударить их же, в эти моменты я будто себя не ощущала и не понимала что делаю. после этого приходя в себя я убегала куда-то подальше и ревела сожалея о содеянном. и всё же я нашла другой способ, я начала заниматься селфхармом. годы шли, порезов на мне было всё больше и больше, бабушке становилось всё хуже, она переставала узнавать меня, переставала понимать где находится, часто несла всякий бред будто она сейчас находится в больнице, а не в родном доме, могла пойти куда-то, по её словам домой после чего мне приходилось её искать и молиться чтобы меня никто не увидел рядом с ней, иногда могла быть агрессивной, взять нож и кричать чтобы мы её не трогали иначе зарежет. но мама и дядя (дочь и сын моей бабушки) будто игнорировали тот факт что ей нужно лечение, причем что у дяди были возможности свозить её хотя бы на осмотр. матери же нужно было куча операций, из них она сделала только две, большая часть денег и так уходила на её пожизненные лекарства без которых она не смогла бы двигаться. и вот мне 16 на тот момент я встречалась с парнем уже полтора года, даже впустила к себе домой и соответственно была уже не девственницей, я отдалась чтобы почувствовать себя нужной и любимой. и в этом возрасте происходит полностью переломный момент, бабушке резко становится хуже, она становится лежачей и ухаживать за ней приходится мне, она кричит целыми днями и ночами о смерти, мне приходится убирать естественные отходы иногда поднимать её на постель если она с неё падала. мы с мамой не могли есть и спать поскольку в этом ритме с постоянными криками спать было невозможно и сил чтобы даже встать с кровати не было. бабушке начали давать снотворные, но даже самые сильные помогали лишь на несколько часов после чего всё начиналось заново, в доме стоял резкий запах, хоть я и вымывала всё, полностью вывести его было невозможно, иногда мне приходилось через силу готовить для нас, хоть я уже сама понемногу сходила с ума, мне 16 и на мне два инвалида, это правда страшно. дядя же не хотел её забирать или же как-то помочь мне, он только делал вид что переживает, иногда привозил лекарства и проведывал бабушку говоря что я плохая хозяйка. мне же эти три часа сна снились только кошмары, начало что-то казаться в темноте, но об этом я никому не говорила, вдруг в психушку отправят. я жаловалась своему парню на что он пытался как-то меня подбодрить, но я достаточно распробовала вкус жизни и говорила ему что всё что он говорит не работает и такого не будет, на что он злился и говорил мне заткнуться тогда раз мне не нравится как он меня поддерживает, после таких пару раз я и вправду перестала говорить о своих проблемах так же приняла решение расстаться. и вот когда стало уже совсем невыносимо дядя положил бабушку в больницу где ухаживают за такими, я наконец-то смогла поспать, вымыла всё до блеска. тут приехал парень с цветами, конфетами и всякой ерундой, я решила дать ему шанс только из-за того что он как-то постарался для этого. через пару дней бабушка умерла, я была настолько разбита что помню смутно те дни, похороны, я ссорюсь с дядей из-за того что не хочу быть в одном доме с трупом родного человека, угрожал что убьет как увидит меня и всё в этом роде, на самих же похоронах я ревела навзрыд, это было ужасно. вечером же пришел мой парень, мы помянули и легли спать. в ту же ночь он начал приставать ко мне в том смысле в котором вы подумали, мне стало до тошноты противно от него, от всех его действий. в то время я очень похудела, можно было изучать биологию прямо по моему телу, он говорил что ему не нравится моё тело и он меня не хочет. в то же время я общалась с парнем сестры, (внучка дяди) сёстрами мы друг друга для удобства называем поскольку мы одного возраста. он был мне по душе, как-то уж сильно мы понимали друг друга, но сестра назовем её Маша очень ревновала его ко мне, на что я ей много раз говорила «давай я прекращу с ним общение» но она устраивала истерики потому что я была единственным его другом и Маша не хотела чтобы он меня лишился по её вине. со временем я начала понимать что влюбляюсь в парня Маши, оставила это в секрете от всех и рассталась со своим. на следующий же день после похорон слегла моя мать, она тоже стала лежачей и мне тоже приходилось ухаживать за ней, иногда даже подтирать ей зад, как бы противно это не звучало. ещё не успев отойти от смерти бабушки и всего что было мне приходилось готовить маме есть, но готовить ей нужно было по определённой диете из-за болезни желудка. поэтому готовила я почти что только ей, на себя сил не хватало. мне приходилось держать быт, ездить за продуктами и успевать учиться, к слову о учёбе, я забросила её в шестом классе, а в тот год меня чуть не отчислили потому что я не заходила ни на одну пару. маму то ложили в больницу, то выписывали и так продолжалось несколько месяцев. пока она лежала в больнице мне приходилось жить у дяди с тетей, и каждый день ездить к себе домой, тетя же недолюбливала меня и всю нашу семью, но почему-то видно это было только мне. Маша с назовем её парня Даня, ссорились каждый день и бывало по нескольку раз, она приходила ко мне за советами когда у меня и моих проблем было достаточно, но тем не менее я хотя бы отвлекалась так. в один день тетя сказала Маше что думает что Даня изменяет ей со мной, у меня хоть и была симпатия, но я не посмела бы так поступить. а Маша была из тех кто все свои секреты и личные дела рассказывает своим родным иногда выдавая мои и секреты Дианы из-за чего мы могли повздорить. Маша поверила тете и налетела с этим всем на меня, но мне было нечего скрывать, но всё же в конечном итоге они расстались, Даня признался мне и мне было нечего терять я тоже рассказала всё, позже мы начали встречаться, хоть это было и плохо по отношению к Маше, но почему я должна отказывать себе если им вместе не быть точно? Маша должна была понять меня, но этого не случилось, вся семья настроилась против меня, дядя который должен был взять опеку надо мной после бабушки отказался от этого назвав меня шлюхой, почему-то все уверены что я встречалась с ним за спиной Маши, может со стороны и выглядит всё это странно и быстро, но хотя бы сама Маша должна понимать что это не так, она ведь видела всё происходящее, но все факты она отрицает. из-за этой ситуации меня чуть не отправили в дет дом, оставили только для того чтобы я ухаживала за матерью, что я делаю и по сей день. мне страшно за моё будущее поскольку я даже не учусь, мне больно от всего пережитого и того что я переживаю сейчас, я не хочу больше ничего чувствовать, не хочу больше ничего видеть. я безумно устала, хочу свободно гулять и беззаботно жить как и все в моём возрасте, но к сожалению у меня нету такой возможности. если вы прочитали всё это до конца, оставьте пожалуйста хоть какой-то совет. в любом случае спасибо за то что читали и прожили вместе со мной немного моих воспоминаний. (если что-то кажется вам нереальным либо же что-то из текста непонятно, большинство деталей умалчивается, да и я уже вымотана, вижу что допускаю ошибки, но переделывать пожалуй не буду, ещё раз спасибо)",37,1753706713.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbf6jl/мне_18_и_я_не_хочу_больше_существовать/
"How to distinguish depression, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD?","How to distinguish depression, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD?

My psychiatrist is treating me for generalized anxiety (pregabalin) with medication after I told him I have generalized anxiety disorder. This is based on a book on the subject and his YouTube videos. My wife says I have ADHD (also based on a book she's currently reading :-)). This is a very fashionable diagnosis among psychiatrists and psychologists these days. I feel like I have depression – I took the Beck test and got a score of 27, ""Your symptoms suggest you have severe depression."" One thing is certain: I don't have suicidal thoughts, but nothing brings me joy, I have no motivation, and I'm depressed, my sleep is a mess. Is there a way, a test, to distinguish between these conditions? Does the psychiatrist just pick and choose which medications will work?",2,1753763139.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc215g/how_to_distinguish_depression_general_anxiety/

"Lowk might kms, might not, no one will care anyways lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 cant wait to find out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣","Yeah, I would commit but knives are too painful lol, I tried to slit my wrists and only saw my blood but I wasnt bleeding, 🤣 I guess I'm so bad at everything I do I cant even kill myself right, guns are too expensive, and so are drugs, so I keep getting yelled at by people for walking in the middle of the road when cars are coming when I go out. I don't purposefully waste the car and walk into the road, I just walk on autopilot and cross the road without realizing, anyways, if I were to die instantly from a car crash I wouldn't be mad, I've been getting really mad lately to the point where I almost had a heart attack, and I was lowk happy thinking I was gonna die soon, but I clearly didn't. So the point is, I wanna die, but I'm not gonna kms, but I want something to kill me. Also, I hate myself because I feel like I have no right to be depressed. I live in a place in Lower Income central Florida in the US every house where I live is under 130k and 1 story, small yard, ugly trees, no community, sad, depressing, 1 bathroom, very small home. But thats the most of it, I have a park not to far from my house, but I have no friends so it doesn't matter. I have alot of stuff I guess, I have a ps4, an Xbox, a Nintendo switch, a PC, 2 monitors, a nice keyboard, a big TV, a bunk bed, everything a boy could want, so I should be happy. Right? Well, sadly no. I used to live in a really rich area, like house were 200k or more, still 1 story bc I'm not a millionaire, but it was a medium sized 2 bathroom house with a garage, with was so cool to me, U had everything when I lived there, friends, family to hang around, I enjoyed playing games and actually enjoying my life lowk. Then I moved, I lost all my happiness, I deadass cant get happy from anything, I love music but it all just makes me sad, any type of music makes me sad, I cant play my favorite games anymore bc they make me nostalgic and sad, I don't smile when doing anything, anymore and I don't feel like life will get any better, I fucking hate when happy idiots try to come up to me and tell me some bullshit like life gets better, it fucking doesn't so go fuck yourself, I hate when people who live in 2 story houses with more than 3 rooms try to tell me something like they understand, they fucking don't, im miserable, I hate my fucking life. Deadass got nothing to live for and I'm never gonna own a house and Im never gonna find the love that I want, like I said I would kms rn and livestream it for those who wanna see, but its too expensive so whatever, I guess. Anyways sorry for wasting your time, ask me anything. If you're typing some corny shit like ""don't do it trust me it gets better"" you don't fucking know me bro, so don't type stupid shit like that 🤦‍♂️ anyways bye 😴 ",2,1753761832.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc1mej/lowk_might_kms_might_not_no_one_will_care_anyways/
Tried to confide in a family member but got insulted instead,My aunt is a psychiatrist so in the past I have tried to talk to her about certain issues. Tonight I tried calling her because I was feeling suicidal and depressed and just wanted someone to talk to.  I’ve honestly been in a very dark place and desperate. Instead of comforting me she went on a rant how I’m manipulative and treated her very badly because I never take her advice. She said think about how it makes ME feel when you don’t take my advice it makes me feel useless. I honestly think she’s the manipulative one for saying that.  Just because I’m not cured doesn’t mean I’m not following your advice like wtf. It made me feel 1000x worse and more of a reason to isolate. I can’t believe she would talk to me that way when I’m clearly suffering. It was honestly such a shock that I was struggling to find the words. She wants me to call her back tomorrow to tell her I’ve followed the advice she’s given and I said no im not. I just needed a kind ear and instead I got yelled at. No wonder I want to die.

I don’t know how to keep going. I just needed to say this somewhere.,"**Please stop scrolling for a moment.**

I’m not an influencer. I’m just a guy who lost almost everything -  
his home, his family, and his hope.

I’ve been working on an album for months (– no, this is no self promotion, this is a confession)  
not in a studio, but in an abandoned factory I live in.  
I’ve gone through a divorce, I barely see my son,  
I drive taxi at night and restore old car interiors during the day to survive.

**This month everything collapsed.**

A Bolt driver crashed into my car and insurance company took me just as a bad joke.  
Then a long taxi ride never got paid.  
Then I tore my tire which I replaced,  
but now I don’t even have money for fuel to continue my night drives.  
No joke – I’m days away from losing my last chance to survive.

But I didn’t want to go down quietly.

Yesterday, after a complete breakdown reached me,  
I recorded a raw **unplugged demo** of my last song...

No studio. No team. Just me,  
a mic, a DAW, a drum set made of a table,  
toilet paper stand holding a knife, spoon, ashtray –  
and every last bit of pain I had left.

This song is the only thing I have left.  
It might even be the last I ever release.

I put **all my pain** into it. I believed I can share it here... but only thing I found, I can't do it a way I need it. A way I have a time for... A way, that can save me...   
All the time I believed in words, that... well... Because sometimes one song can hold a whole human soul.

But this doesn't matter as well... I never used Reddit before, but hoped it will be the place where I can share my thoughts through my music... Or my words... F\*\*k... It's full of rules, you can't even move a wrong way without being deleted... I created this profile for starting my project 2 months in advance from now on, but well, I don't have any time left... I finished whole my album, but now I already know, that I won't have a chance to release it... It's just a matter of time (hours? maybe days?) till everything collapse completely under my hands. I don't have any other solution to this situation, only waiting even while I am still trying to survive, to work, to go on... But this system, this system is not forgetting... You fall down, so is there any help? Well, yeah... a hard kick right into your face and no more chance to get up, even when you need just a little time, a few days to catch up... few fc...in days more to catch up... no, money won't forget a bit, money is everything in this world... money means more than life... Just one week to catch the time up and I can hold everything together, but no way... I don't have this week... I am done... Don't know what to do anymore... I lived my life to find out it's ending up in my 40's... It's still too soon to fell down with no way back to normal life. I held myself for years, I was quite happy even when I lived here in this godforsaken place... but just few unlucky days in a row to find out your life ends here, at this point... I lost the fight already... One day? Two days? Maybe 3 days for mobile operator cuts me off from the world completely. Than even here, in this abandoned factory I pay rent... Yeah, another few days to loose this place... Debts rising faster than I can make money. System is set up that way... Falling down with no chance to get back... Great. I don't want to live this way anymore. I can't simply catch up that system. I CAN'T ANYMORE... If I disappear from here in the next days, it won’t be because I didn’t care, but because this world didn’t care enough to give me one more shot.

It is my confession...

  
If anyone is interested in this song, you can find it in my profile... As my first and also last shout to the world we live in... 

If anyone knows of any solution to the situation like this, please let me know. But I don't know any existing one...

I hate this so much.,"I don't know if this is anything serious, but I always feel like everyone is talking about me or is judging me. I feel like their a camera in my light with no lightbulb, I keep convincing myself it's there and I covered my posters and family pictures with sticky notes on my wall because I felt like they were judging me. I also feel so weird with my long mirror on my closet door and I'm convinced someone is watching me through it even though no ones there. I act like i'm talking to a human in my mirror and that someone is watching and judging my every move on the other side, I avoid watching or writing things in front of my mirror and I always want to cover it because I always get a feeling someone is watching me in the comfort of my own room. Everything that has eyes in my room I feel judges me, I'm also convinced that my stuffed animals have cameras in their eyes and someone is posting the footage and that's why people give me weird looks in public or watch me. Whenever my parents and family members  are speaking in  creole which I don't understand I always feel like their talking about me or being rude in front of my face. Sometimes I know their talking about me too. I wish I didn't feel like this and this isn't the first time I felt everyone didn't like me too, during the school year I was actually thinking of suicide and I might have been depressed, but I don't want to say that because if I wasn't I might come off as rude and ""Self Diagnosing"" and I feel bad for thinking I was. I just feel like theirs so much going on and I don't want to be sad ever again after everything that happened with my feelings during the school year and I'm scared to feel like that again. It just feels like it's easier to feel judged and sad then happy and positive. ",2,1753760233.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mc13xy/i_hate_this_so_much/

And now I’m home and feel like dragged back into my hole. Resentful that no one cares to do anything for me. I’m just a slave to all those around me.  I thought this episode had passed but it seems that it has not. I am worried I have anxiety about leaving the house as a whole. All I do is work and come directly home or run errands and come directly home. When I even start making plans to leave the house I’ve been getting irritable and overwhelmed. - I’m in between therapist. I know it would help. My insurance is tricky to find someone.

Why am I so depressed when everything is fine?,"Sorry, this is kinda long…

Hi! I’m 15F, and I don’t understand anything. I understand I’m a kid/teen, and I’m just super young. I’m immature, but I’m positive I have depression. I was never diagnosed because of my parents beliefs. My dad thinks that depression is a phase and what I’m feeling will go away. But it doesn’t. It’s been stuck with me since 5th grade.

I feel so guilty because people have it way worse than me, and my ass is complaining, hurting myself, and fantasizing about my own death. I live fine. I’m middle class, and I live comfortably. I have parents who immigrated to the states to give me a better life. They give me what I want and need, and I appreciate them with all my heart. I have friends, I don’t get bullied much, and I have a wonderful boyfriend. So why do I feel so lonely? I'm depressed all day, and all I think about is dying or hurting myself. I can’t get out of bed; I don’t have motivation to do anything. I can’t even take care of my hygiene. I just want to die, but I hate pain. My life seems so good, but I look like an ungrateful brat. 

I told my parents about hurting myself and depression, and all I got was “think positive,” “we don’t believe in therapy,” “you have nothing to be depressed about,” “are you hurting yourself for attention?” and more. It hurts so much hearing that from family. I have no motivation to live, but the only thing keeping me alive is pain because I don’t have the balls to take my own life. I’m scared. I have no plans for the future, and I know I’m young, but time passes. I’ll end up on the streets or living in my parents basement being a nobody. I want to get better. But feeling this way is so comforting. I don’t know what to do. Why do I feel this way?

I tried suicide but I failed.,"I'm 19 years old and let's start from the very start of my life when I was born. My mother gave birth to a premature baby 1 month premature I was supposed to be born on October but september is my birthday month. This shit caused something in my lungs I was on baby ventilator for 6 months. Before I was born my family was very rich like the richest of the city but my father and his older brother had some issues and he snitched and income tax raid was there in my house so everything was gone. My father would legit walk 7-8 kms weekly just to get me injections when I was 1 year old. We were 3 brothers. Let's say for example. Special brother, older brother and me. My special brother was mentally challenged he was born right but due to some fever he got some mental illness. I'm the youngest brother special brother was older than me like 5 years and older brother was the oldest he was 8 years older than me. After my special brother became a disabled child my mother opened a NGO daycare centre for all special needs child just because she knew what pain the parents feel to take care of the child and she would do it for free. 2012 the special brother passed away... I uh I don't know what to say about it but I cried a lot. As I said I had lung issues so In my childhood i was not able to play any sports I used to like basketball but if I dare to play it. My lungs would just take me to bed for another month making me a living dead body. Finally when I was healing and became healthy in 2017 my father used to earn well we even made 2 houses and all suddenly he got a brain stroke and everything stopped. I used to live in the centre of a city and doctors told my father that he needs to go somewhere quiet. When you're just entering your teenage years and this happens your whole life changes. I was so shocked. I cried a lot. I screamed. We shifted out of city into a town of Hilly area. My brother was just 19 when my father had the stroke so he took responsibility of the business. My mother was also struggling to keep the ngo running because there was no money to invest. And donations were not enough. Then slowly my brother became very angry and my new father. He used to beat me. He legit choked me once till I gave up on living. My dad was the same he used to beat us when we were children aswell. Well lockdown time comes around corona. My father owned several warehouses of wine and alcohol and my brother used to manage it. He started drinking. He was very brave. He was very strong. His confident would legit shake anyone standing in front of him he made several contracts with the army and started a construction company and used to take contracts with army itself. I was in another small school. The school was owned by a friend of my mother's. In that school i started learning music. Annual function came I did my performance and it was so lit everyone started clapping and shouting my name. Every single parent there clapped but my father was not there 🥺 I was so sad I cried on spot and told everyone I'm just too happy but my mother knew it. Everytime in morning I would see father's dropping their son's off the school and loving them and here I am that one cursed child. My mother developed a heart disease in which her heart valve is leaking. My father called me and shouted that's what you wanted motherfucker your mom's gonna die. I cried that day aswell everyone in my house was fighting and I was the youngest so I was the first to be beaten. I tried killing myself 2018 but I could not when I tried to hang myself i accidentally chewed my tongue due to immense pressure on my throat and immediately did a pull-up on the fan and removed the cloth. Lockdown passed by my brother got married and his wife knew nothing about home. How to iron and all everything I taught her because she asked for. One random day my father tells me that go around the block and show her everything like near house. I grabbed the umbrella because I had a feeling it was about to rain and it did but his wife was there without umbrella and to i offered her that you can have it I will quickly run back home she said no let's just keep going. In one umbrella I was like okay if u want then she held me hand and that shit was so bad I told her I'm not like this. Straight of she laughed it off like I'm a joke then one day she was ironing clothes ( everyone in my house irons their clothes themselves ) I told her to  set the temp lower as it was a thinner shirt of my brothers she told me how to I showed her nd she kissed me dude. I told her again that please stay in your limits your my brothers wife and she looked at me this time and told me to leave strictly. I tried to tell my brother but I was scared that he will think it's me because it's always a man's fault. After some weeks she was gone to her hometown for some work and from there she told my brother that your younger brother tired to grab me and pushed me on to bed and tried to kiss me. My brother said that to my parents in front of me when I was eating the food..I was so shocked and I told everything he hit me and said don't fool me you're always like this and he kept hitting me I was unable to walk. That day I told him you trusted that lady of few weeks over a brother of 17 years. Don't talk to me ever again. And we never talked straight forward ever again. My brother had a babygirl on October 2nd and he was so happy. He died at a young age of 26 on 29th March 2023. 😔 After that I came to know about the truth in his voice recordings there are numerous arguments of him and his wife and one of them is about me that my brother would never touch you so she cried and my brother said alright I'll make him away from u. I can't live both of my brother's died my father is paralyzed my mother has heart issues I wanna commit suicide. I wanna die asap my birthday is on 17th September and I have made up my mind that I'll kill myself on that day cause I genuinely can't take it anymore:( I used to hate my brother but he was trying to save me all along and 🥺 even when he died I could not do anything to save him. When he died my mother shouted at my face that it should have been you and not him. I'm so broken. I can't anymore. Please god if you're listening I have seen enough now please.

Venting. I fucking hate being sober things have just been worse,I have been sober for about 5-6 years and I fucking hate it. I feel like things have just gotten worse since being sober. Life has never just been okay and doing anything is just a battle. And if I need to take antidepressants to be numb why not just do drugs at this point. I had a pretty rough childhood and have an incredible hard time connecting with and generally trusting people so I have absolutely no support system. Even when I try I feel like an outsider. My job is having layoffs so I don’t feel comfortable investing in any form of hobby.

Can I even call this depression?,"Do you need to consider suicide or self harm for you to have depression? I've dealt with depression for most of my teens into mid twentys. I've been self medicating with marijuana or alchohol for way too long. It comes in waves. Most days are bearable, but some I see myself treating my personal relationships like shit. Too much pent-up anger and frustration with the situations I've dealt with. I've never thought of sucide as an option because I'm not that selfish. I've been raised on putting others before myself. Im numb and I feel like the only use for me in the future is to support my future children and my family. I guess I'm confused about what this would be considered.

Gabapentin causing depression?,41/M here.  I quit drinking 12/10/24 after my drinking started to get out of hand.  I was prescribed 300 mgs of gabapentin 3 times a day for anxiety.

I don't have it all.,"people like to think that I have it all. 

I come across as a confident person... 
am great at having conversations... 
sound great on paper... 
am generally likable...

but... it's all superficial.

in my dating life, all my relationships fail.

when they stick around long enough to witness the real me, they think twice...

I've been diagnosed with both ptsd and pdd (persistent depressive disorder) – a pretty shitty combo. 

it gets hard to manage.

and they don't understand it because they haven't been through what I've been through. 

it makes me feel unlovable.
(or maybe I'm just perpetually unseen)

I hate it so much, this catch-22.

it's not my fault that I'm going through this, but I'm still the person who has to do all the dirty work and heal. 

I feel like a burden to others.

I want to find someone who will love me for who I am – a person who struggles with their mental health, but is trying.

but, I feel hopeless about it... 
what's the point of getting close to people anymore...?

I just feel like I'm the problem and kinda want to get rid of it.

Can't even talk to people in VR Chat 😂😂😂. I'm such a fucking brain dead loser.,"It's so fucking clear talking to people helps, so why don't I do it? Oh my god I'm so dumb for believing life had any other purpose. God I'm so dumb. It's all about having friends, it's like duh... But I actually started believing that my hobbies or self love would matter. But no, right when I'm starting to build confidence I get this sudden panic attack and feeling like all efforts are for nothing and I should've put more energy into talking to people my age. Oh well too bad it's what I want secretly to suffer so I feel different from others. I'm such a weird fucking creature actually. I'm actually a lunatic the way I behave and avoid having a social life at all costs. I need to kill myself fast unless I find friends, which I can't even STILL do in VRchat. Hahaha crazy. I guess people(me) never change ❤️😂

Like people don't even take me seriously anymore. When I'm crying and depressed it's just like ""get your sorry as away from me"". And I agree. I'm borderline retarded because I don't learn that socializing is the only thing that matters. -have a good day: spend it with friends. Have a bad day: you get to distract yourself with friends. Do anything: better with friends.

But yeah no I keep ""forgetting"" that life isn't about me, it's about fitting in. Fuck my dumb ass nerdy retarded ugly cringe fuck face that thinks he is above others. I secretly think I'm gonna be like cooler than everyone just cause I choose to be lonely. But then I end up here whining about being lonely you know what I deserve this shit. Don't wanna socialize? Then suffer alone. I serve no purpose except making people uncomfortable or sad. This shit is ridiculous. And I believed my family and therapist that I should believe in myself but u know what? No I fucking don't and I will never do until I feel included somewhere. Being alone is stranger bizarre and puts anyone at risk of mental issues. Fuck everything else except socializing. Workout? Try 3 x reps of talking to women instead and see how tough you are fucking faggot. To think I think I'm gay sometimes just shows how fucking strange I've become. I never get an answer, I never feel ok. I will when I'm included in a social circle that fits my view of ""cool"". And I'm tired of pretending anything else matters in terms of mental health.

My depression made my life look pointless and I can't stop fearing this despite improving so much.,"Hello, I'll try to be as precise as possible. And before starting this: I apologize for any grammar mistake as english is not my main language or if I talk about my life a bit too much and sound like a jerk.

Last year I went through what I think that was the worst year of my life. The point is, because I was falling in a spiral of decay and depression I had to face the ""typical"" depression symptons:

Lack of motivation, anxiety, feeling that I'm worthless, that there's no point in doing anything... and a million more things that I'm sure you guys have been through. Like I mentioned, this happened last year and after realizing that the only solution to fixing myself was, well, myself, I was able to get out of that depression, to the point where I could think about those fears without going back into a state depression. (And I apologize if my way of wording it sounds like it was easy to fix it and offends anyone who's going through it, it's not my intention). So this year everything went very well, I won't say a lot but I got scouted for a big football club's youth team and I couldn't be happier but, then there's this one feeling that I still couldn't beat.   
  
The fear of knowing that I'll die sooner or later and that everything will feel pointless.. I don't want to age, I don't want to be an adult and go into my 20s, then 30s, 50s... and then miss being young and have regrets. It all feels so, depressing, I could be in the happiest moment of my life then I'll be hit with the ""you know once this is over you'll miss it, and then you'll age, and then die."" I hate it, I need help to cope and get over this because I just really don't want this thought to ruin every moment in my life. Heck I'm still so damn young yet I already miss being even younger, so what when I'm older? What will it be of me? Why does it feel like nostalgia is a poison? And the worst of all is when I'm trying to learn something, or improve myself and, despite being so damn young, my mind goes like ""hey it's too late for that, you'll be a grandpa sooner or later so then what? What's the point of working out for example if at some point I'll look in the mirror and be a grandpa, then what? what's next?""

And it's terrifying. I feel so egoistical, knowing many would kill to be in my position yet it seems only I would be unfortunate enough to sabotage myself when I should be grateful... But I just can't stop thinking about that fear... I really need help to understand it and challenge that though, I need to beat it and make sure this doesn't fuck up my life again after trying so much... I need to accept that death comes sooner or later and that life itself is meaningless but I just can't, sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up one day, or sometimes I just wish I hadn't been born at all. I really can't let this thought make me suffer my entire life.

I apologize for getting so personal and if I sound like a jerk. My life looks so perfect in the eyes of everyone but for whatever fucking reason, it doesn't in mine, fuckass ""you'll be old and die one day so why would you do anything"" hurts so much. And it makes me want to die, seriously.

TL;DR: Depression made me think life is pointless because we all die and it's still making me feel so bad despite improving my life so much and I can't find a reason in doing anything at all but at the same time I don't want to have an average life without achievements.",6,1753729802.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbpbjm/my_depression_made_my_life_look_pointless_and_i/

"Trauma, homelessness, and now urgent psychiatric care. I need help.","After 3 months of trying to survive one thing after another, I’m now at a point where I need psychiatric hospital care. I’ve been self-harming and recently attempted again. I don’t have the means to pay the upfront fees for admission and evaluation. I need help..financial, emotional, anything to get into a hospital as soon as possible.

I’ll try to keep this short, but a lot has happened in a very short time, and it’s been overwhelming.

Three months ago, I made a post on Reddit (since deleted because of people harassing me or sending sexual messages..) during one of the lowest moments in my life. A kind stranger reached out to me privately to try and talk me down. I told them what I was going through..how my mom had taken out debts with loan sharks and put them in my name. I had less than a week to pay them off. On top of that, my mom and stepdad were kicking me out of the house. I was terrified, alone, and desperate.

After some back-and-forth and them making sure I wasn’t trying to scam anyone, they offered to help. They sent money so I could pay the debt and make a deposit for an apartment. I was able to get a place. I was very thankful. But it didn’t stop there..

The loan sharks didn’t leave me alone. They found out where I lived, harassed me constantly because they think I was going to report them to authorities outside of town. Even after that, they kept showing up, trying to break in. I was living in constant fear.

With that same kind stranger’s help, I escaped and took a bus and ferry across the country to get as far away as I could.

Eventually, I was able to stay with some roommates. But everything I had been through began to catch up with me. I wasn’t stable. I wasn’t safe from the world or from myself. My mental health was spiraling. My roommates tried to be there, but it got too much for them. They said they couldn’t live with me anymore. So I left.

I was homeless for a few days. Then, once again, the same person who had been helping me all this time gave me money to stay in a hotel. That’s where I am now.

But I’m not okay.

I attempted to end my life in the hotel just a few days ago. I don’t want to keep doing this. I don't want to keep relying on that person. It has been too much.. But I also I don’t want to die. I just need help. Real, professional, psychiatric help before something worse happens. I know I need to be admitted to a hospital. I want to go.

But the problem is, most hospitals here require upfront fees for admission, evaluation, and professional assessments even if insurance covers the rest afterward. The cost ranges between $500 to $1500 USD depending on the hospital. It’s money I just don’t have. The person who’s helped me so much has already given a lot and is doing everything they can. They and my former roommates have been calling hospitals nonstop, trying to get me in. But we’re stuck on this: the upfront cost.

So I’m here now, reaching out and asking if anyone can help. Whether it’s financially, emotionally, or even just helping spread the word. I know this all sounds unbelievable. I barely believe I’m still alive writing this. But this is real. This has been my life for the past three months. I’ve survived things I wouldn’t wish on anyone.

I’m keeping things vague here to protect myself and others involved, but if you want to help and need more details before doing so, I or the person helping me can share more privately (depending on what my roommates are okay with too).

Please. If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you can help in any way..Thank you..",2,1753743261.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbv2d9/trauma_homelessness_and_now_urgent_psychiatric/
Every Relationship feels transactional,"People are just there until you serve them good and when it is over, they simply just vanish.

None of it feels real," nobody feels really truly genuine half of the time and they just end up feeling like scripted dialogue without any real thought or emotion behind it


I've been thinking about if I'll even leave a note when I decide to do it and sometimes I find relief in imagining my own death and how others will probably cry and mourn over me at least that will probably be genuine


I have been pushing myself for a year or two maybe three, I can't tell when this all started but I have slowly lost all desire to be human or to be a person


I've been faking my interactions with my psychologist or therapist or whatever they are for most of the time they ask if I'm suicidal and I say just a little and they ask if I have any intentions or plans and I say not really but I have almost every intention just not a solid plan


it make me a little sad that my family will most likely live to see me dead even the older ones but what am I supposed to do?


Sometimes in school I imagine I have a gun in my mouth and imagine what would happen if I shot myself in front of everyone


I hate that my few ways of escaping will soon disappear or be blocked behind other things I will have to do and so all I have left is my mind as imagination where I slowly rot inside and can feel myself becoming apathetic and even resentful towards others


A long while ago about a year ago on two occasions I put my mom's gun in my mouth and almost pulled the trigger since then it has been locked away in a safe


I have a knife that no one knows about in my room just a few feet from my bed hidden I think about using it every day


I am so behind in school that I have slowly stopped caring and have told myself it won't matter later because I'll be dead


I'll be a senior in a two weeks and I feel nothing no sense of accomplishment or pride just tired and hateful towards my education


I'm 17 and will most likely live a bit longer even if I don't want to at least until I am finally able to do it

I locked myself in my room and watched YouTube every day until I turned 17.At that point,Because I'm such a loser, my dad decided to stop giving me money, so I had to work.McDonalds employee, painter, security guard, concierge, hairdresser, all these jobs I didn't do for more than two weeks, then I quit.

Starting again,"Do you ever just wish that you could start again, that you could lose your memory and become someone completely different? 

I feel so jealous of people with amnesia because they get to pick and choose what they remember, what they choose to keep. I know it doesn’t really work like that but the most craven irrational parts of me are still envious

I just want to forget all of the bad things. I’ve got a major trauma anniversary coming up and I’ve not really got anything going for me. Nothing seems worth it anyways. I’m medicated so I can take care of myself and pretend to be happy but nothing ever feels worth it. I feel like a robot, like a facade of a human being.

I used to be such a creative, happy, imaginative child, but that all ended one day. Now I’m just rotting while I’m still alive. I like feeling sad because at least it means I’m not numb, but maybe that’s the way to not exist- by not feeling anything at all.

Once this desire starts, it stays with me for so long. I’m either scared or angry these days, I don’t know which is worse. At least when I’m scared I don’t lash out at people around me. I just want to feel okay but I know that I’m doing everything I can. There’s no way out of this.

I’m just tired of caring so much. I’m just tired of everyone else being selfish and refusing to understand parts of me they find objectionable. I wish that I was dreaming and I’ll wake up as someone else.

I don't particularly want a long life.,"I'm not actively suicidal, and it's not like I *want* to die. I simply do not want to live to 70, 80, 90 - it just sounds very tiring, to be honest. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying there's anything wrong or bad with being old - I do hope my grandparents and parents get to have a nice long retirement - I'm saying I'm personally not particularly keen on the idea. I just want to be able to reach my goals, make a positive impact on those around me, and hopefully go out in a non-painful way. Will I regret not being able to see more of life? Maybe. But I'd rather have a well-lived life than a long life that I never lived at all. 

I'm not the type of person to follow the traditional trajectory of life. I don't expect to have much family or friends when I'm older; I have always been very introverted and more interested in losing myself in my interests than socializing. Some people would call it sad but it works for me, and the few close friends I have understand me well. I know a lot of people want to live a good long life, maybe with the person they love and their family - I don't, not really. Maybe it's because of my struggles with mental health, with family issues, maybe it's something intrinsic to who I am, but I just don't. At 13 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 18, at 18 I wasn't able to imagine myself alive at 25, and I don't see that changing. I've made my peace that I'll likely always struggle with my mental health; nowadays I just want to make the most of the time I do have on this earth.

I've never told anybody in my real life about this. I'm a fairly ambitious person, and I am a risk-taker, more often than not at my own detriment. I know the people who genuinely love me want me to play it safe, live a long and quiet life, but that's not me. I'm not going to be able to settle for that, not when it's way too close to how I've been living - being alive solely because you're not dead, and you have too many regrets to pass on. I pretend I understand where they're coming from but in reality I genuinely can not give up on my goals, and I can not worry them by straight up saying I don't want to stay here for very long.",2,1753739360.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbthui/i_dont_particularly_want_a_long_life/
Venting and need support,"First time posting here. I [29 F] have been struggling with depression since I was eleven years old. I’ve been living in survival mode since I was a baby. My father was not present in my life. My mother was so abusive to me. She taught me to ignore my intuition (even though I still feel it) and never taught me about boundaries. I was her emotional punching bag and therapist all throughout my childhood. This dynamic set me up to be abused as an adult, by people I’ve been in relationships with and my friends. I have never felt safe for long. I turned to drugs and alcohol for many years and it helped in the short term, but made things so much worse exponentially. I’ve been abstaining from alcohol for almost six months now. I am in a healthy relationship for the first time ever and it’s like my self-hatred is even louder. I can tell it’s bringing my partner down. I am in therapy weekly as much as I can, but my therapist is out of town for weeks at a time multiple times a year (at least three times in the past six months) which could be normal, I know therapists need a break, but I’m not sure the dynamic works for me. I feel like I just vent to her in our sessions. My depression always gets worse around my period, but in general, I am always sad and internalizing everything and punishing myself. I am finally seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow to try and get diagnosed and get on meds. My therapist believes I have OCD, depression, anxiety, and CPTSD. It hurts so bad. I’ve wanted to give up so much. I am embarrassed as well and feel so terrible for the weight I have put on my partner’s shoulders. They assure me they love me and want to see this through with me, but I feel so guilty and spiral because of the guilt. I am trying, but it is so hard. I am so strong to keep going, but I am scared it’ll be too much one day. All this suffering feels like it outweighs the good times in my life.

I'm kinda not depressed. Just detached from my real emotions.,"No matter what medicine I take, it only changes how my usual feeling about life feels like. I still have this enormous hole or wound that feels like my soul is escaping out from. Sometimes usually when talking to people about it or becoming sucked in to the Convo I can get distracted for seconds at most.
But it feels so obvious that I'm detached from the strong emotions I have inside, that I guess are too painful or intense I'd rather be numb from them. It doesn't feel like depression, more like an energy that's being drained slowly when I'm not living the life I'm supposed to. It's quite scary that it feels like my chest everyday becomes more and more light(dissasioated from my heartbeat) because I can't stand how uncomfortable it feels to feel my heart barely pulsating. 

It really feels more like my confidence gets smaller and thereby my feelings for life. I have no will, no strength and no movement. It's just me, thinking about nothing and doing nothing. Can medicine really help me open up that wound inside me? It feels impossible. I'm only on an NDRI and antipsychotics so nothing really for anxiety or increasing serotonin. But I'm kinda done, I've tried Citalopram and short term anxiety medicine and it's just kinda changing how my confidence or happiness feels- not making it better or worse.

It makes me hopeless. ",1,1753752310.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbyf30/im_kinda_not_depressed_just_detached_from_my_real/
Lost marriage,"So it’s the day after our anniversary, which you’d think would be a happy time, but no… today was awful. All day, my wife has been playing the sad card, saying they’re unhappy and hate the day. I’m still getting blamed for all the problems in the relationship. I don’t get it. It’s like nothing can ever be their fault.

Here’s the kicker though: when I got home, they acted like everything was perfectly fine. Like they hadn’t spent the whole day tearing me down emotionally, and then they wonder why I’m upset. It’s like they become a completely different person, acting like they have zero idea why I’d be hurting.

I tried to make our anniversary meaningful. I didn’t expect much, since they kept saying, “don’t get me anything, I don’t want to celebrate.” But then they gave me a card. I had one too, I just wasn’t planning on giving it but decided to after I saw they got me a card. I didn’t want to be rude, but it’s still sitting there unopened. And while I don’t need them to read it, they’re clearly making a point to point out they haven’t opened it, like they just want to hurt me.

Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling depressed. I’m tired of having my emotions stomped on. It’s getting harder and harder to cope with this kind of treatment. I miss being happy. I miss enjoying life. I can’t feel those things anymore because I’m constantly walking on eggshells.

The hardest part of all this is our child. A divorce would be brutal, especially when it comes to custody. My partner acts like they’re entitled to full custody, such as they joke about it often, saying things like “when I leave you, our child will stay with me.” They say it like it’s funny, but it hurts. Because this kid is my whole world.

I’m the one getting them up every morning, taking them to school, picking them up, getting them ready for bed, showing up to every school event and activity. I’m the one who rearranges my work schedule if they get sick. I do all of that, and I don’t even complain because I love my child, but it’s just expected of me. And when I do have responsibilities at work and can’t drop everything, my partner loses it, giving me every reason they can’t do it instead and that I need to drop everything instead of them. 

It’s like my work isn’t seen as important or valued at all. They seem to think what I do is easy or meaningless. My therapist says this behavior is narcissistic, and honestly, I agree. I also think there are deeper mood issues going on.

I just want to be happy again. I put on a mask every day, pretending things are fine while emotionally I feel like I’ve been beaten up. I’m already on medication for anxiety, and while that helps a bit, the depression has gotten worse over the past year. I feel lost.

I hate myself.,"Growing up I had a troubled childhood, my mom pushed my dad out of my life when I was 2, didn’t see him again until I was 18. My mom had a few different boyfriends, didn’t learn half of their names, then when I was 4 or 5 she was with a dude until I was 14. They adopted a baby, and I wish they never did tbh. He SA’d me from age 8 to 12. I tried to unalive myself multiple times until I was 16, was into drugs pretty heavily, until I got pregnant at 20. I got my shit together and was seeing somebody, moved in together, and broke up after 3 years. I moved into my mom’s house, as rent other places was insane, and I couldn’t afford anything as a now single mom.  The baby my mom adopted is now 18, he steals from me, and mom, my grandma and even my 7 year old.  He smokes weed CONSTANTLY in the house, where my 7 year old and elderly bedridden grandma live, and my mom doesn’t even ask him to stop. She lets him do absolutely anything he wants and he gets away with shit all the time because she simply doesn’t care. I hate even leaving my bedroom, being around my mom makes me anxious and I genuinely feel like I don’t even love her I just tolerate her, and it makes me hate myself, but o feel like she’s never been a mom, I feel like she never actually cared about any of us. I have 3 older brothers, too, they all left the second they could and I feel like they kind of feel the same on some level, they all love her because they have to because she’s their mom, but why don’t I feel that way? Am I broken? Because the fact she lets my brother do anything and everything just irritates me so much and it’s put so much strain on me. Recently he went into my grandmas wallet, took her debit card and went to the ATM and took $1100. And what did my mother do? Nothing. He denied it, then when he admitted it, she did nothing. Because he threatens to unalive himself. For fucking why? Because he’s gotten everything he fucken wants and needs, his life isn’t shitty by any means, my mom and her ex aren’t together but her ex is married and my brother visits him twice a month and gets whatever the he wants there too.. the last therapist I went to told me I have depression and anxiety and I need to practice my breathing.. like wtf even is that? I stopped seeing her cause that’s ridiculous. Also I feel like if I say too much, there’s gonna be cops involved and then I’ll be out on my ass with my kid and have no family at all, and idk.. am I broken? I just turned 29 and I feel like my whole life is a mess.. if I could afford to move, I’d be in a different country honestly.. anybody looking for a slightly damaged 29 year old with a 7 year old boy? 😂 if I don’t laugh I’ll cry.

I can’t go on feeling like this anymore. I won’t.,"It’s likely that nobody will read this. That’s OK. I just want to put this out there for my own sake. 

I really can’t do it anymore. Yeah - some pretty shitty things have happened to me lately. But that’s inconsequential. I’ve always had a bleak view on the world and am overly pessimistic. I’ve watched myself slip further and further into a dark place for years. 

Nothing interests me anymore except changing the way I feel with substances. I can’t remember the last time I felt a genuine moment of joy. I can’t take care of myself anymore. I don’t look forward to anything, and my days are consumed by simply fighting to keep my head above water and keeping up appearances in which I pretend everything is going fine. 

I just want to go back to laying in bed. I am just 28 and feel like I already died a long time ago.

This dark cloud above my head is relentless. I tried fighting it for a while, but now, I think it has won the battle.

I know deep down that my days are numbered. And sometimes, it gives me relief to know that soon, I won’t have to worry about that dark cloud anymore. I won’t have to worry about anything at all.

"I have depression, and my 4 month old son needs surgery.","Hello, Reddit. I see people use this place for all kinds of things so this is me trying to use it. I’m scared. Last year I had a mental health crisis, and I went to spend a week at a facility and it was the best thing that happened to me. I work in a hospital, and I see all kinds and deal with all kinds of stuff. But nothing could prepare me for when I was my own worst enemy and ended up planing my own death. It was a fleeting thought, I immediately told someone at the hospital and ended up in a PESS unit for 24 hours, then a behavioral health unit for a week. 

Diagnosed and treated for clinical depression. Apparently the care team thinks I’ve had it since I was about ten when my grandfather was killed in 9/11. But this isn’t about that. This is about how after everything, I’m feeling better. My wife gets pregnant, I’m on top of the world, and my son is born with Sagittal synostosis, also known as scaphocephaly, is a condition where the sagittal suture, a fibrous joint on top of the skull, fuses prematurely.

We took him to CHOP in Philadelphia, got him the best of the best and we did everything early enough where his surgery is scheduled for mid August. It’s not considered brain surgery, but a neurosurgeon is going to be present because of the nature of the surgery. But I shook the hand of the man who was going to put my baby boy to sleep, cut his skull open and place springs inside it. 

Of course I’m glad it’s happening. But I just got my world put back together. I’m scared, and with my depression I’m worried that I might let my own mental get in the way of the fact that he’s going to be ok. I can look at statistics, and do all the research all I want. We even met families who have perfectly healthy babies taking the exact same care team as us. 

But there is a voice in my head, warning me that I don’t know what I’m going to do if something happened to my son. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking apart from prayers and kind words for a father who is battling his own demons every day like I’m sure many of you are while also giving 100% of my concern and energy into my boy. He’s my whole world.

How to not to spiral?,"Im 23F and i’ve been on Zoloft for about 2 years now. I’m glad I’m on the medication as on a regular day, i can shower, sleep, cook and maybe even clean and its a good day but when I’m hit with some small event that makes me stressed, i find myself wanting to die. 

I don’t have a job despite trying and even giving my resumes to businesses that aren’t hiring. I tried DoorDashing and Uber and theyre not hiring in my area. My bills are overdue and my power is about to turned off tomorrow (thank you PG&E for the 48 hr notice ig). 

Objectively I have a good life, I don’t pay rent and just have to take care of the house I live in, and I only have to pay for amenities like power, water, etc. I have a working car. I’m doing fairly decent in school and even joined the student council at my college. 

I have so many things going for me and so many things I haven’t done yet in my life and yet just one stumble like bills or stress from being jobless makes me wanna die. 

It’s not even sadness that I feel, it just feels like… suicide is a *not good* solution for whatever problem i have, if that makes sense. It always feels like theres a gun on the table.

I guess my question is how to take the solution of suicide off the table? And deal with stress like a normal person ig? 

I dont have friends to talk to and I already worry my mom too much about my mental health so I don’t want to tell her. I went on a walk around my house to see if I’d feel better. I ended up enjoying the scenery but felt like it would be a good place to die. Of course that didnt make me feel better lol..

Am I depressed or just sad,"I’ve never posted on here (I rarely post on Reddit at all),  but I guess need to know what’s going on. I’m just really upset at the moment. It’s obviously summer and the entire time I’ve been feeling really hopeless. To give context, my mom’s an addict and she hasn’t lived at home for almost a year now. She’s been in and out of treatment for about three years, and even now that she’s better, I still feel like she can’t offer support. I’m going into my junior year in high school and as a highly ambitious student, I wish I had the same support and resources offered by my friends parents. Everyone’s off doing things and traveling and doing internships and being with other people but I’ve been stuck at home almost daily because dad works and mom isn’t here. All I’ve done this summer is practice my sport in the evenings. A few weeks ago I fell into my first truly depressive episode- I guess I just realized things would never get better at home. School and my sport and everything else that being an older teen brings are hard enough with support. I’m usually thrilled to start the new school year, but recently I feel like I have nothing to live for. I know people are usually like “it’ll get better don’t say that” yada yada but I genuinely believe that. Sometimes I cry for hours on end just because each day feels like a period to fill. Suicidal thoughts aren’t rare. I came to my mom the other day (a nurse) and said I needed to see someone. She accused me of “having an agenda” and drug seeking and said this is just teen feelings as a result of her stuff.

But I can't seem to take any joy in those things. The pain wins every time. The physical pain is caused by a disease that has no cure. Treatments aren't working well anymore. The emotional pain has been ever present since childhood and speaks to my upbringing. I am in therapy. I helps, sometimes. The psychological pain is what's getting me. It just crushes my spirit. This feeling of abject worthlessness.

No one loves you when you don't love yourself. And I don't. Never have, and at this point, probably never will.",5,1753714368.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbibiq/older_and_worthless/
I just want to say it out loud,"I just want to talk about my suicidal thoughts and plans and ideas and concepts,out loud, as they occur to me. EVERYONE else is the world can just spew whatever pops into your head, but once suicide, or end of life stuff comes up. People lose it. I dont want to talk to a therspist, because im not 'working anything out' i just want to say my thoughts out loud, and muse, like everyone else!",1,1753748328.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbwzj4/i_just_want_to_say_it_out_loud/
Post is not a joke but genuine concern although trying to brighten up yalls day,"I used to beg God (christian) to get me a nice body when I was like 12 or some I wished for like a body that would be loved and desired. Now that Im older I regret this wish. But as I've been going through depression for more of my life than not, I used to joke, everytime God Fucks up he should make my ass bigger. And I've ironically noticed my ass getting bigger. And I think this is the weirdest accidental correlation. I think my boobs have gotten smaller but my ass is definitely still growing. And with the way its going God will need to start working some good into my life cuz I got that natural bbl. (On a more non silly note I wonder if depression can make you retain more water or something,  I thought I was at an age where you cant grow ass anymore only lose it😅) silly but like this is like the things that make me think how unserious depression is, like the more I cry the bigger my ass gets like bfrl. Can I be happy instead 🤔",1,1753748244.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbwygh/post_is_not_a_joke_but_genuine_concern_although/
Hopeless,"45m. I’ve been single for my entire adult life. I struggle with several mental and physical health challenges, including ADHD, depression, anxiety, sciatica, obesity, and a learning disability. These issues make daily life very difficult and have made it hard for me to build stability or move forward.

I live with my brother in Seattle, but I often feel like he sees me as a burden. I also hate where I live. The weather here makes me feel worse, and I don’t have the resources to move somewhere else or create the kind of environment I need to feel better.

Financially, I’m in a tough spot. I haven’t paid much into Social Security in nearly ten years, and I have no assets. I keep thinking about retirement and whether I’ll ever be able to afford it. Things are already so expensive, and it feels like the cost of living is only going to get worse. I don’t see a path where I’ll ever feel secure, and that uncertainty adds to the weight I carry every day.

I left my job to go back to school, hoping to make a fresh start, but now that I’m a year in, I worry I made a mistake. With how fast artificial intelligence is changing the job market, I’m afraid there won’t be work for someone like me by the time I graduate. It feels like everything is shifting, and I’m falling behind.

On top of all this, I feel incredibly alone. I’ve always wanted a significant other, someone to share life with, but it’s always felt out of reach. I want someone to talk to, someone who sees me and wants to be there. That kind of connection is something I’ve longed for, but I don’t know how to find it or whether I ever will.

All of this has left me feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. Lately, I’ve been asking myself what the point of any of this is and whether life is even worth continuing. I don’t know what kind of help I need, but I know I need support. I can’t keep doing this alone.",3,1753726412.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbns92/hopeless/
So Checked Out,"I am extremely checked out from life currently. I have come to the conclusion this life will never be what I once dreamed of, nor will it ever come close. As much as I love my daughter, a lot of that comes from having her at a young age from r***. I never wanted to be a mother. Now I’m one, along with being a stepmom to 2. I love my fiance. I love our kids. But I’m just tired of the repetitiveness that comes with parenthood. It feels entirely like I’m living for everyone else all the time instead of ever being able to do what I want. And even if I could, we’re poor, so not like much travel, home improvement (we rent on top of it), or fun outings could even happen. I also hate working extremely bad. I’ve begged my fiance to switch jobs or something to make enough money so I can quit but he seems like he has no motivation to do so. I’m just so checked out. I have no dopamine. Like I legit feel happy so little. It sucks.",1,1753747800.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbwslm/so_checked_out/

I feel like i've regressed as a human since I became depressed,"Has anyone else felt the same way? Ever since my depressive episodes began around a year ago, I feel like I've become mentally sluggish. When I try to have conversations with others it just fizzles out due to my unconsciously awkward behavior, which I never have done before. I make mistakes that I used to never do, and I zone out constantly. I am always tired no matter how much sleep I get. I feel like a kid stuck in the body of an adult and I constantly have thoughts that rationally I understand are immature, but I can't help but shake. It's so pathetic.",14,1753698750.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbcmt9/i_feel_like_ive_regressed_as_a_human_since_i/
Tired and not in the mood for anything,"I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm missing out on my life and my potential. I got my first computer at the age of 10 and it quickly became a great passion. Over the years, I discovered programming, 2D/3D graphics, reverse engineering and so on. 4 years ago, I finished my studies and wanted to become a freelance web developer, but to do so I had to build up a portfolio. So I spent several months programming on personal projects. Unfortunately, at that point I started to develop an intolerance to gluten, but also to junk food in general, so the food I ate had a huge impact on my mood and fatigue. Living with my parents, with no income, I'm very dependent on them. I don't eat very well at home; for example, a meal might consist of two small packets of potato chips. About 2 years ago, I started to develop anhedonia. I don't feel any cravings anymore. Neither for computers, nor for all the other things I used to enjoy. I feel as if I don't know who I am anymore, as if part of my identity has vanished, it's a horrible feeling. Today I often feel depressed, the food I eat at my parents' makes me extremely tired, I have no energy, I wake up tired even though I sleep enough. I go out about once every three months and have no friends. I don't have the strength to do anything.",2,1753733672.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbr0we/tired_and_not_in_the_mood_for_anything/
i’m so tired of being the only one who cares.,"diagnosed with bipolar 2 when i was 17. knew it was coming, my mom had it but refused to get diagnosed so we didn’t have a diagnosis for her to go off of but the behavior lined up. i’ve noticed recently that when im neutral or manic, things are always fine. people will actually interact with me, want to hang out, want to see me, etc. but the minute i go into a depressive episode, everyone just ignores me. they stop reaching out. they stop inviting me to do things. or they just completely dump me. i wish i could get it. i can’t control the way i am. i can heavily medicate it all i want, but other than that i cant do shit about it other than try to work on it. and that’s what i’m always trying to do. i miss the people ive lost because of it so much but i know im alone right now, and am gonna have to stick to it.",4,1753719723.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mbkq04/im_so_tired_of_being_the_only_one_who_cares/
Probably A Reflection Of My Life Choices,"I could probably write a memoir of unfortunate events, twists I never saw coming, and coping methods that had less than desired outcomes. Not drugs or anything like that - but it suffices to say, the perhaps the road to hell truly is paved with good intentions, and probably accurately describes my attempts at a happy life. I have a lot, don’t get me wrong. I wonderful house, a well paying job, a beautiful child, and a loving husband who tries his best. 

At the end of the day I’ve slowly lost every connection outside of our little family and feel largely alone as each chapter has unfolded until there’s all but a few characters left in the story. I can’t help but think it is me, and I think I am just rather frankly unlikable, have gotten to a level of desperation for connection, and/or not in a position to give the attention a relationship requires to have one.

The quick and dirty: 
1. Drunk mom and a few steps from poverty - signed up for the navy to go to school and start life on the right foot. Left behind myself sister to suffer in that hell alone, and lost her later in years because of her sanity, to which I heavily blame myself for having left to save myself.
2. Met a wonderful man and knew what I loving family was like - followed through with enlistment to “change my stars” - lost it all, he couldn’t handle deployments and many of my friendships faded with time along with this.
3. Fell in love while in, and regrettably turned out he was married. It ruined my rep and I had to leave. Lost friends of course there too, or perhaps realized I didn’t really have any.
4. Decided to be empathic to above asshole’s situation (it was a marriage for citizenship)and paid the price several times over for this, as his facade faltered over the years. This cost me friends and family and ruined my self confidence and sense of self worth.
5. I moved out of the state for work after graduating to get out of a dead end job and start a career with the education I’d managed to obtain. Lost more friends in some pretty spectacularly disappointing ways - some as petty as asking them to pay their portion of a cell phone bill as I struggled fanatically myself, and some family died in the interim. 
5.1 Married my childhood love and lost the respect of the adopted family I once called mine - because I “stole him” when I moved. So much to the point that they begged him not to marry me.
6. Made some no contact choices because of toxicity to stop the panic attacks with what life line relationships I had left - the desperation for contact was not worth the strife and punishment to foster it.
7. Made friends and close to family in the new place, but had a child. We moved back so my husband could have his family, and our child could know what was left of hers. This family tolerates me at best, but it’s clear I am not welcome nor valued in that space.
8. I am in a management role with a young child to care for and no opportunity to foster relationships. But at this point, I get the feeling that I lack friends not just because I am not in a position to have them, but rather because people do not see me as someone they’d care to engage with. 

I often get the distinct feeling that no one wants me around unless they get something out of it - sex, money, leverage, work related assistance, etc. I run myself into the ground for people for little to know reason hoping for value in some one’s eyes, I’ve come to realize perhaps it’s because I was only valued if I was quiet, did what I was told, and did chores as a child. No time was ever spent together to just - be together, as a family. Perhaps this is why I fail here now, with no example of how to just be. I’ve often wondered if I ever had the skillset to make a true friend - and it must be a skill, because I fail at it horribly. As a result I feel empty and the face I put on for my family is getting harder and harder to fake. I don’t know what to do - and no clubs, meetups, etc aren’t the answer here, though I appreciate the advisement to do so.

I just don’t know what to do, and while on paper in my nuclear family, it’s a successful life, the loneliness and lack of support is driving me into a hollow suit of a person who now just makes the perfunctory moves to appear present and engaged for their sakes and theirs alone. Or I’d likely be gone.

Going outside kinda works?,Just came in from the pool at my parents house and I’m completely sunburnt but my depression has decreased a bit?

Running out of ideas,"I have no idea where to post this type of stuff because I don't post, but here it goes.

Generally, I see myself as someone with bad luck, or even blessed with bad timing. But I keep trying to get through life, hoping I can live a life where I'm finally happy. However, every day feels like my normal day to day is slowly slipping out from under my fingertips. I've spent most of my life missing out on opportunities out of pure fear of the unknown (and things costing money). This year I had been pushing to be better and try to live a life I wanted instead of had to live, I'd been saving up and working overtime to save up the money to finally move to a state where I could be more than just a blank mirror of a person. I was so close, but then due to pure happenstance I lost my vehicle and thus my savings. I could keep rambling on about how sad I've made my life out of pure design but I just don't know what to do anymore.
